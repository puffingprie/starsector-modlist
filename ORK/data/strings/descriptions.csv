ork_dreadnotv2,SHIP,"One of the largest ship designs produced by the Bultach Coalition, the Fregairt-class is a heavy anchor found in larger fleets, bolstering a massive array of weapons. One of the Coalition's stakes in their struggle to oppose the Tri-Tachyon Megacorporation, this capital ship is primarily used to hold the line, unwavering, even against the most powerful foes such as the Astral or Paragon designs of Corporate fame. 

Carrying a massive amount of armaments, any fleet spotted with this vessel is rarely trifled with. ",,,,
ork_vencha,SHIP,"Inspired by an earlier, modified version of a Venture cruiser, the Ramala-class serves as a battlecarrier for the Coalition Navy, bringing fighters to the front line while keeping a heavy set of armor and weapons on hand in most engagements.",,,,
ork_faster,SHIP,"Trading armor for unmatched speed for its class and armaments, the Striopach-class is excellent at running down weaker ships and giving chase to damaged foes, often able to avoid any ships it cannot take in a direct fight. Quite popular with the more aggressive captains in the Coalition navy, who prefer a speedier alternative to the more common, heavily armored cruisers.",,,,
ork_smasha,SHIP,"A heavily armored, heavily armed destroyer, the Smàladair-class is capable of harassing a wide array of ships, or even forcefully repositioning them. Notorious for it's ability to use it's heavily armored front as a battering ram to disable shields, or to finish off weak ships.",,,,
ork_hammah,SHIP,"A support ship often seen escorting larger Bultach vessels, the Cruinn-class brings a cheap form of a heavy ballistics package to the front line. Capable of delivering much needed blows to armor that would otherwise require whittling down, often with lower grade weaponry.",,,,
ork_grot,SHIP,"Heavily armed and armored for it's class, the Dreach-class is a common frigate design used by Bultach for harrasser roles. Uniquely, the Dreach excels at soaking up damage for vulnerable ships of higher importance.",,,,
ork_bigscrap,SHIP,"The first capital design made by the Bultach Coaltion, the tried and true Daiche-class battlecarrier has seen several iterative upgrade packages over it's lifetime. While somewhat outdated compared to more modern designs fielded by the Persean Sector, the Daiche battlecarrier is a reliable anchor for smaller fleets and has survived over a century of continual combat against vastly superior oppoents in some cases. 

Heavily armored and slow, this Daiche has cemented itself as part of the Bultach Navy's fleet doctrine. Typically the flagship for smaller patrols, it is meant as the anvil to the hammer of it's escorts and packs enough firepower to consistently survive multiple engagements.",,,,
ork_spacehulk,SHIP,"Made of countless discarded hulls, chunks of stations, and often from cannibalized small pirate vessels, but just as often made from the various scrapyards left drifting in the void of space, no two Space Hulk-class vessels are the same. Regardless, each one is fitted with enough weapons to wrestle with stations, fleets and carries a terrifying amount of hangar bays to allow force projection over a large area. Worse still, even destroying it often leaves the carcass for pirates to reclaim, brought back with a vengeance each time. Thankfully, the vessel is extremely rare at best. Only aquired by the best and most ambitious pirate lords.

The ""zombie"" ship nature of a Space Hulk gives it something of a sinister reputation with captains and spaceport bars. Rumors spoken of seeing these crumbling hulks leading massive raiding fleets. Additionally, these vessels are a logistical nightmare with most repair crews as there is no proper standard when one arrives in a port of call for said repairs, often having additional plating simply hacked on wherever damage is done.",,,,
ork_interdictor,SHIP,"Made for hunting down phase ships, the Plàigh-class excels at just that role. Plàigh-class ships are equipped with specialized systems that allow the capability of ""rippling"" a small area of P-space around it, making the process far more expensive-- serving as an excellent support vessel to dissuade any cheeky strikes from phase vessels. The Plàigh-class is also able to hold its own against other ships, albeit to a minor degree outside it's intended role.",,,,
ork_prong,SHIP,"Fast, tough and carrying a heavy amount of armaments for it's size, the Fithea-class is a simple ship in construction for it's size. A fairly common destroyer in Bultach Navy service, Fitheas are used as an escort for trade fleets, or to pad out gaps in combat fleets which normally don't carry as much firepower, such as pickets or light patrols.",,,,
ork_bees,SHIP,"A small carrier often seen in minor Bultach patrols, the Snàthad-class brings much needed fighter support to their fleets at a respectable price. While not able to engage in close combat itself all too reliably, it's still a common sight due to the support value it provides.",,,,
ork_mining,SHIP,"Originally made in the early years of the Company War, back when the Bultach Coalition was a rather more desperate polity, the Mèinneadh-class is a mining vessel militarized for war. Most Mèinneadhs feature hastily welded armor, which is then put together en-masse to quickly gather much needed resources without the threat of loss to hostiles. Despite this, Mèinneadhs are still seen often enough due to their cheap design.",,,,
ork_old,SHIP,"One of the first ships ever produced natively by the Bultach Coalition, the Roimhe-class is a cheap overhaul of the Mule-class combat freighter, resulting in a surpisingly powerful destroyer, albeit not quite as useful as more expensive ships of it's class. Roimhe-class vessels have gained recent popularity even among Independants, due to their cheap conversion costs and the common nature of the Mule-class to begin with. Thanks to this, they are widely exported, constructed, and often serve many budding mercenary commanders.",,,,
ork_scrimb,SHIP,"A small, exceptionally nimble frigate, the Sgoinneil-class is seen in nearly all Bultach fleet compositions. Capable of harrassing larger ships and dueling with other frigates of similar size and roles.",,,,
ork_bastard,SHIP,"A frigate entirely dedicated to bringing along fighter, and minor missile support, the Madach is found in nearly every Bultach Coalition fleet, hidden behind more heavily armored allies to provide valuable support to any engagement.",,,,
ork_mech,SHIP,"A curious design, the Buail-class is a hard-hitting, well armored ship sporting two, built-in and downsized weapons; the Hellbore, and the Mark IX autocannon. It is an exceptionally rare sight, due to just how old it is.

Unfortunately, due to the logistics needed to support the integrated weapons, the Buail lacks a shield generator, making it exceptionally weaker over prolonged battles, or against heavier hitting armaments.",,,,
ork_battlecruiser,SHIP,"In order to avoid being outmaneuvered by the high-tech ship designs used by their Tri Tachyon opponents, the Bultach Coalition has taken to designing, and fielding the Nadhmòr-class Battle Cruiser, usually found in larger war fleets. Poorly armored compared to most capital ships, the Nadhmòr has incredible maneuverability to compensate for it's more fragile nature.

On top of this maneuverability, the Nadmòr-class packs heavy strike potential-- able to mount a large array of missiles to make decisive attacks against key targets. Following it's success, it has only seen more and more common use, a mainstay in Bultach fleets.",,,,
ork_tail,SHIP,"One of the newest ships developed by the Bultach Coalition, the Daignich-class carries an impressive flux core which mainly powers its unique ship system. Though it sacrifices the armored nature of most Bultach vessels in order to be utterly focused on support, this ship is not to be ignored by most experienced Captains, as it's presence on the battlefield proves more and more valuable as time goes on.",,,,
ork_murtach,SHIP,"Only very recently developed, the Murtach-Class Phase Cruiser is the result of a completely different approach to phasing that emerged from the Bultach Coalition, this starship represents a stark departure from the elegant and graceful approach to phase technology.

The Murtach-Class forgoes the notion of finesse, instead opting for an brutish and forceful entry into the realm of P-space. With thunderous roars and tremors from the hull of the vessel, the cruiser punches its way into the dimension, being propelled quickly along by the violent energies produced.

The ship then is then violently expelled from the alternate dimension with a chaotic eruption. Disruptive energies surge around the ship as it is forced back out of P-space by the energies that brought it in, frying any unprotected vessels around it as it emerges, and sending lighter ones careening back from the sheer force of it.",,,,
ork_racer,SHIP,"The newest frigate found in Bultach fleets, the Ghean-class is a nimble ship with a respectable weapons package. It's most powerful feature is it's Flux Booster ship system, which allows it to keep up with targets attempting to flee and keep up offensive operations for much longer periods of time.",,,,
ork_bigracer,SHIP,"Essentially the big brother to the Ghean frigate, the Dhaich-class cruiser is an agile design meant to harass whatever it cannot kill on its own. Often found on the front lines with frigate escorts, more often than not.",,,,
ork_crusher,SHIP,"Covered in hulking armor plates and bristling with forward facing armaments, the Aghaidh-class is capable of truly awesome firepower for its class, as well as being able to withstand withering punishment itself. While slow and lumbering, the Aghaidh can still be found on the frontlines, soaking up damage for it's more fragile allies.",,,,
ork_skrunkly,SHIP,"A hardy, common frigate found in many Bultach fleets, the Gath-class frigate is simple, tried and true. Though underwhelming in it's PD capabilities, it brings enough strike potential to see much use in just about any fleet found in the Coalition, able to take quite a bit of punishment, for a frigate.",,,,
ork_speeder,SHIP,"A destroyer focused on strike capability and speed above all other, the Luath is capable of accompanying frigates on the frontlines, providing a mini-anchor for a battle's first engagements before larger vessels come into play. Even against larger foes, the Luath-class destroyer can often provide a valuable distraction, or a deadly thorn, if it manages to flank an unsuspecting capital.",,,,
ork_thrasher,SHIP,"Deceptively well-armed and armored for it's size, as a smaller cruiser, the Mòran-class is designed as a relatively cheap way of punching through enemy lines, or using brute force to reposition a ship. Straining even the toughest of shield generators with it's sheer speed, and enhanced mass upon impact-- smaller vessels often being outright destroyed by the wild charge. The Mòran is particularly favored by the aggressive and reckless Captains, due to it's tendency to get in knife-fighting range.",,,,
ork_tiny_freighter,SHIP,"A common freighter seen in many Bultach fleets, the Asal-class is a dependable-- if under-armed cargo vessel. Gaining a bit more capacity over the Mule-class in exchange for not quite being able to defend itself, but seeing one without a proper escort isn't exactly a common occurance to begin with.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#fighters,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_light_fighter,SHIP,"A simple, useful design found in nearly all Bultach fleets sporting a carrier, the Brònach-class fighter is decently reliable in it's ability to overwhelm smaller wings, as well as lone ships-- though this can often lead to high casualties if a encountering a competent PD grid.",,,,
ork_heavy_fighter,SHIP,"A slower, more expensive fighter, the Seillean-class is less often used due to lengthy replacement times. It makes up for this with a respectable armament, including a downscaled Teth plasma cannon, which it can fire in small bursts to devestate other wings head on, or chew into larger ship's armor.",,,,
ork_bomber,SHIP,"The only bomber fielded by carriers in the Coalition, the Chaneil-class bomber is fairly slow, but carries a heavy payload of two downsized Caillean torpedoes. It is capable of both pressuring shields with each pass, or devestating armor and hull.",,,,
ork_defense_drone,SHIP,"Custom made for the Sally-class, these refitted, small mining drones can provide a much needed PD boost for their host hull, as well as a way to get a bit of extra damage in on the enemy in a pinch.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#supers,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_superdread_main,SHIP,"The pearl of the Bultach navy, both a powerful morale and propaganda piece often used to strike both fear and awe into those who view it, housing thousands upon thousands of crew, and easily outsizing-- as well as outgunning entire stations. The DòrnDhè is often credited as the will of the Bultach Coalition's citizens, their rage made manifest.

It is to spearhead their assault against Tritachyon's planets, with the capability to reduce the surface of any colony to a sheet of glass solely on it's own. The vengeful spirit of a spiteful populace.

Doubling as a last resort, it presents the option to embark upon it as an ark ship, to carry a large chunk of the population to safe haven, should the Bultach Coalition's war come to that.

",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_redemption_main,SHIP,"One of the legendary sporeships; that which first seeded planets for life in the sector, changed into a grotesque amalgam of Luddic wrath. Able to serve both as a base of operations in and of itself, as well as rain holy justice upon any servants of Moloch in it's path. Where it goes, destruction follows in it's wake. Almost regarded as a myth, with how rare this class of vessel is, but tales of horror are still told in hushed tones by spacers who have supposedly caught sight of these monstrosities. Tales of holy horns blaring, and massive pather fleets following along it's radioactive plume.

Heavily armored from it's sheer size alone, the Redemption can brush off strikes that would prove destructive to many other ships. Using it's sheer weight as a battering ram against any foe unfortunate enough to have drawn it's ire. Capable of going toe to toe with entire battlestations, and reducing them to molten, radioactive slag. The Stars held no anger, only disappointment. Man found themselves lacking in the face of damnation. No heresy could protect them from their punishment. May the holy void have mercy on them.

""Upon this rock, I will build my church.""
""To which even the most depraved servants of moloch may be redeemed.""
""Blessed by his holy void in final absolution.""

",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_sgr_main,SHIP,"The Sathar-class Heavy Dreadnought, the pinnacle of Coalition ship production, stands as a towering behemoth that eclipses not only its peers within the Coalition but potentially the entire sector. This awe-inspiring vessel boasts an armament of unparalleled magnitude, engineered to endure protracted engagements and effectively lay siege upon the mightiest of stations. While its power is undeniable, the Sathar-class carries a substantial logistical burden, a trade-off deemed acceptable by the Bultach Coalition in light of its remarkable combat performance.

Originally conceived as a bulwark against any incursion into the cherished home system of the Coalition, the Sathar-class Heavy Dreadnought quickly proved its worth. As time progressed, it underwent meticulous refinement and fine-tuning, solidifying its reputation as the epitome of concentrated firepower. These imposing dreadnoughts now serve as the definitive symbol of strength during diplomatic engagements, providing an unmistakable show of force that compels factions with overly warm relations towards Tritach to reconsider their allegiances.",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_judgement,SHIP,"Originally conceived as a mundane mining station, the Judgement-class vessel underwent a radical transformation at the hands of religious zealots who saw its potential for a higher purpose. What was once a pragmatic hub for resource extraction has been reborn as a space-borne arbiter, a vessel imbued with sacred purpose and an unyielding commitment to the extremist ideologies of its creators.

The Judgement-class vessel boasts an arsenal that reflects its newfound religious identity. Its hull carved into to fit as many weapons as its frame can handle, its main mining beam jury-rigged and overcharged to incredibly dangerous levels. This vessel, once a mere workhorse of industry, now wields the power to dish out divine judgement upon any deemed servants of moloch by the Luddic Path.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#stations,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_bulwark_station,SHIP,"The Bulwark stands as a testament to the ingenuity and collective strength of the Bultach Coalition, a union of those who would seek refuge from Tri-Tachyon, and a fortress from which to strike back against their oppression. This colossal defensive space station, hovering ominously at the outer edges of its host planet, is a marvel of engineering and a symbol of unyielding defense.

The Bulwark is a bastion of impenetrable defenses, designed to withstand the most formidable tides the sector can muster. Carrying a truly terrifying amount of guns, as well as a massive railgun mounted atop its main body. Bultach propaganda often tout that it would take a battlegroup regiment and then some to begin chipping away at the Bulwark.

The Bulwark stands as a shining sentinel in the vastness of space, a beacon of security and cooperation among the stars. It exemplifies the commitment of the Bultach Coalition to preserving peace and prosperity throughout their system, and hopefully beyond.",,,,

,,,,,,
ork_bigscrap_path,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

The first capital made by the Bultach Coaltion; hangar bay instead filled with the necessary components to fuel a singular, massive engine-- giving this armored vessel a truly terrifying speed boost. Even more weapon mounts fitted to it's well armored frame, this tried and true vessel is now a nightmare of a patrol officer.

",,,,
ork_mule_mk3,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

This simple combat freighter has been overhauled by the Luddic Path. Strapped with as many mounts as it can hold, and fitted with a dangerous amount of engines, it makes a surprisingly formidable, albeit fragile destroyer.",,,,
ork_ramshackle,SHIP,"A twisted amalgam of hullfoam and shoddily welded armor plates, no two Ramschackle-class cruisers are quite the same, coming from different base ships. Nevertheless, they pack a respectable amount of armament, and can take a heavy beating before being ripped apart.",,,,
ork_vencha_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

This Luddic conversion of the Ramala sees it made much faster, it's hangar bay collapsed and welded into additional armor plates, as well as a more weapons haphazardly added to it's frame. Albeit more rare, this Path cruiser is a extremely potent threat.",,,,
ork_hammah_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

Already a heavily armed destroyer for it's class, this Cruinn conversion has been pushed to straining speeds, it's large ballistic mount converted to fit missiles instead, giving it terrifying strike potential.",,,,
ork_skrunkly_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

Already a somewhat nimble frigate, this conversion sees the Gath made insanely fast; fitted with an engine nearly too big for it's frame. Giving up one of it's hardpoints in exchange for two composites.",,,,
ork_dangerous,SHIP,"A horrifying display of Luddic Path engineering, the Goblin is little more than two Gremlin-class phase coils welded onto a larger frame, and then subsequently loaded with as many guns as the already stressed vessel can carry. Fast, but fragile, this ship often supports bigger Luddic vessels.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_mining_p,SHIP,"A pirate converted variant of the Mèinneadh, this cruiser sports a large ballistic instead of the hangars that normally house mining drones. Additional armor has been crudely welded on and it is a viable threat in battle - but still quite fragile due to it's base internal structure.

Originally made in the early years of the Company War, back when the Bultach Coalition was a rather more desperate polity, the Mèinneadh-class is a mining vessel militarized for war. Most Mèinneadhs feature hastily welded armor, which is then put together en-masse to quickly gather much needed resources without the threat of loss to hostiles. Despite this, Mèinneadhs are still seen often enough due to their cheap design.",,,,
ork_loota_p,SHIP,"Already a tough, well-armed ship before it's capture and subsequent pirate ""upgrades,"" this Bruth-class cruiser has had it's cargo holds collapsed and welded into crude fighter bays instead, additional armor forced onto the frame, larger weapon mounts hacked on, and the ship system dangerously overriden to allow higher mobility. A formidable cruiser by any right, but rarer than those easier to procure.",,,,
ork_logistics_p,SHIP,"A pirate conversion of the Giùlain; a tough, well armed logistics vessel before any modifications, it does not fall prey to capture-- and subsequent modification by pirates quite nearly as often as it's less defended cousins, but in the instances it does, it becomes a potent threat. 

Bristling with guns and missiles alike, as well as a salvaged ""Jet Burst"" ship system from another unfortunate Bultach vessel, this ship is certainly not to be underestimated. Though often outclassed in one on one fights with a proper capital class ship.",,,,
ork_bees_p,SHIP,"A rather extreme conversion of the Snàthad, it went from a dependable carrier to an incredibly fast destroyer-- albeit fragile, due to the modifications stripping armor plates from the hull. Regardless, it is a ship favored by reckless and other captains who crave a ludicrous amount of speed.",,,,
ork_prong_p,SHIP,"Following the typical Pirate mindset of ""Who needs point defense?"" this conversion of the Fithea tears away it's only defensive mounts to instead force on two more medium hardpoints. While it can carry a truly frightening amount of missile or torpedo ordnance into battle, it is nigh utterly defenseless against any sort of missiles or fighters itself, which leaves it relegated to more of a support role.",,,,
ork_scrapheap,SHIP,"More a twisted wreck that flies than a ship, the Scrap Heap class carries a blistering amount of guns onto the battlefield-- more guns than its limited flux grid can much handle. Regardless, pirates arn't picky on how to deliver as much lead as possible down range, and will happily construct these odd cruisers if the right junk is available.",,,,
ork_drednot,SHIP,"Thankfully a rarity, the Mastodon, a self proclaimed ""DrEdNOt"" in badly chipping paint on its side is one of the most sophisticated designs procured by the pirates. Not found in any domain historical records or even hinted at in the salvage procured from ruins, the Mastodon is a unique post-collapse triumph of tyranny. It carries a massive amount of guns, fields fighters, and invokes terror in fleet patrols, the pride of any successful pirate lord.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#logistics,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_loota,SHIP,"Finding themselves with dangerous trade routes hounded by pirates, Tri Tachyon and other threats alike, the Bultach Coalition uses the Brùth-class freighter as a means to mitigate losses through heavy arms and armament, albeit losing cargo space to add these defensive features. 

Nonetheless, the Brùth remains a proven, hardy and rugged vessel that makes most pirate ambushers think twice before engaging one.",,,,
ork_tanka,SHIP,"A standard tanker for Bultach fleets, the Mèinlùtha-class was created with the same philosophy as the Brùth-class freighter, trading overall capacity for a much better combat capability to fend off Tri-Tach and pirate fleets alike.",,,,
ork_logistics,SHIP,"A combination of both cargo and fuel capacity, the Giùlain-class is seen quite often in heavier trade and exploration fleets, capable of supplying and fueling for extended periods of time, as well as putting up a decent fight itself.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#bounties,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_alysse_lp,SHIP,"A treasured battleship-- stripped down and haphazardly modified to be a holy war machine of Ludd. It's armor modules have been all but torn off, or integrated into the main hull, leaving room to pack the vessel with an obscene amount of extra firepower. It's unique, defensive orion drive reverted to the base design of the ship system to allow as much speed as possible, to usher along salvation to the servants of moloch. It's clear with the amount of modifications it has been on it's holy crusade for quite some time; the scars of battle showing upon it's hull as anything from stripped paint to plasma burns.

It is not often a Knight of Ludd strays from their path, but this once sanctified vessel is proof enough of what they're capable of in desperation; desperation to wipe the sector clean of it's many sins, to sentence the hordes of moloch to the holy void.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#lawful ships,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_apsis,SHIP,"The Apsis-class, the formidable elder sibling of the Apogee-class vessel, designed for those who seek the pinnacle of exploration and defensive prowess in the vast reaches of space.

The Apsis boasts a commanding presence, meticulously equipped with cutting-edge scientific instruments. Tailored for long-range exploration of hostile territories, Apsis captains are known for their independence and self-reliance, navigating the cosmos alone with unwavering confidence.

Much like the Apogee, the Apsis leverages a potent shield emitter and powerful engines to challenge would-be attackers. While its armor rating may still suggest vulnerability on paper, it can nonetheless absorb a fair bit of damage.

Reserved for the elite echelons, the Apsis-class demands a substantial investment. Only those with the resources to seize one of these hulls for themselves can enjoy this rare combined epitome of advanced scientific and military technologies.",,,,
ork_sisyphus,SHIP,"A thorough and total refit of the Atlas Superfreighter, the Sisyphus-class is quite nimble for its size, and can put up a surprising fight. Often seen leading scavenger expeditions into the unknown, or among the fleet of a rag-tag independant planetary defense. With a respectable armament and fighter support, it has solidified itself as a dependable post-collapse design. ",,,,
ork_veneer,SHIP,"A total overhaul of a Starliner hull, the Veneer-class has it donned in armor plating, reforged entire sections of the hull, and heavily upgraded its flux grid. Though somewhat vulnerable to flanking due to its forward-facing armament, it is nonetheless a useful vessel for those unable to afford more ""official"" and expensive hulls.",,,,
ork_sally,SHIP,"An original design, the Sally-class is quite nimble, fairly cheap, and capable of punching up to a limited degree. Fielding two small, custom-made Defense Pods, the Sally is capable of holding its own against most other frigates, as well as effectively harassing anything above its weight class.",,,,
ork_concoct,SHIP,"The common Nebula-class sees many refits, a more lawful one of those being the Concoct-class. Used to fill up gaps in many independant force fleets and beginner mercenary groups. With its newly installed damper field, it can soak up a surprising amount of damage, while dishing out a fair amount itself.",,,,
ork_arke,SHIP,"The Mudskipper, overhauled into a vessel that can somewhat fight-- albeit often in a more supportive role. This ship is cheap, common, and decent for its asking price. Those picking up these vessels to help fill out their fleet arn't typically in a place to complain.  ",,,,
ork_triumph,SHIP,"The beefier, less nimble cousin of the Conquest, the Triumph didn't see nearly as much popularity as the Conquest. Being critiqued as lacking striking power compared to the battlecruiser. Regardless, a good amount of the battleship was still produced. Although not currently known to be mass produced by any existing faction, the Triumph undoubtedly has a fair few abandoned hulls among the persean sector.",,,,
ork_sacrilege,SHIP,"The Sacrilege-Class capital ship stands as a paradox within the ranks of the Luddic Path, embodying both an object of veneration and a source of internal discord. Revered by some as a divine instrument of wrath wrenched from the hands of moloch, and condemned by others for its perceived deviation from the righteous path, this rare vessel symbolizes the Luddic Path's struggle within itself.

At its base, the Sacrilege-Class is no doubt a vessel of formidable power, its hull adorned with the intricate, ominous symbols and markings of the Path. Yet, what sets the Sacrilege apart is the incorporation of technologies deemed blasphemous by the more conservative sects. Phase-teleporting technology carefully sanctified for use in their holy crusade runs throughout the entire hull, showing a remarkable level of care put into the construction of the ship.

Regardless, due to the time and effort needed to produce a single ship of its class, the Sacrilege is thankfully a rare sight.",,,,
ork_subjugator,SHIP,"A fearsome vessel, the Subjugator-class is known to be built atop the broken hull of a Dominator-class cruiser. It is seen on the rarer side, due to needing a military grade hull to begin with, and a pirate captain with enough wealth and connections to afford the extensive ""overhaul."" Nonetheless, with the bristling amount of forward facing firepower, and the amount of damage it can soak up, the Subjugator-class is a potent threat indeed.",,,,

#weapons,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_rippa,WEAPON,"A weapon no captain wants to be downrange from, the Trì-fillte Cannon is a staple of Bultach fleets. Putting down tremendous levels consistent firepower, with a flux cost to match. Often used by those who desire a more constant pressure than the Mòrangnè Cannon allows.",,,,
ork_thumpa,WEAPON,"The Slige Autocannon, while quite good at shredding enemy shields with heavy, kinetic slugs, suffers from an inefficient flux use to do so. Despite this, it is a mainstay in Bultach fleets, proving dependable and easy to mount.",,,,
ork_layzah,WEAPON,"Rarely seen due to the low-tech nature of Bultach ships, the Fuadian Lance is a straightforward laser, trading EMP capability for pure damage, it excells at pressuring shields and armor alike.",,,,
ork_shoota,WEAPON,A turret comprised of three tpc turrets crudely ripped from battle wreckage. Losing efficiency in the process of being transformed into this massive turret.,,,,
ork_plasma,WEAPON,"Initially designed to be a railgun for hammering down on shields, the Teth Plasma Cannon instead fired much too fast-- resulting in the shell becoming a hot plasma. Nonetheless, quite effective, but quite expensive to mount.",,,,
ork_dakka,WEAPON,"Integrated into the hull of ork Kroozers and locked on a forward angle, these weapons give their fleet a massive level of standard firepower.",,,,
ork_shotgun,WEAPON,"A reliable option for armorbreaking, the Gnèag Cannon is a common choice mounted upon Bultach destroyers and frigates. It boasts a better damage output against shields thanks to the specialized shells it fires, albeit at the cost of being a bit harder to mount, and more demanding on a ship's flux grid.",,,,
ork_big_shotgun,WEAPON,"Originating from a modified hellbore design, the Mòrangnè Cannon shoots high velocity shells that have a potent secondary warhead-- should it impact shields. Though this effect is diminished as the efficiency of the shield worsens, to the point of it being negligible at best. Still, it's high explosive payload alone is nothing to scoff at.",,,,
ork_slug,WEAPON,"The Peilt autocannon, a compact and efficient burst weapon, is a common fixture on Bultach ships. With its simplicity and reliability, the Peilt autocannon provides smaller Bultach vessels with a straightforward means of dealing with shields, but has seen some popularity with other entities.",,,,
ork_tpb,WEAPON,"Built into the Buail, this downscaled Hellbore is an efficient, faster firing variant of the weapon-- at the cost of damage. Regardless, the destroyer can use it to deadly effect, shredding most armor.",,,,
ork_tpb2,WEAPON,"Built into the Buail, this downscaled Mark IX does less damage, and has a smaller burst size, but the sheer efficiency and fire rate more than make up for it; giving the destroyer an easy way to pressure shielded targets.",,,,
ork_bigplasma,WEAPON,"Following the success of the Teth Plasma Cannon, the Teotha Plasma Cannon was made. For all purposes a simple upscaling of the weapon, capable of shredding through shields, armor, and hull alike-- but at a heavy mount and flux cost.",,,,
ork_hell,WEAPON,"A large, crude cannon with shells so large it needs to be directly fueled with AM fuel, the ""Hellburn"" is nonetheless a terrifying weapon to face.",,,,
ork_nailer,WEAPON,"In order to work through tougher shields, the Bultach Coalition made a massive autocannon that fires terrifying lead spikes at high speed. Capable of shredding through hull in their own right, given their sheer size and weight.  ",,,,
ork_bolta,WEAPON,"In an attempt to level the playing field with the Tritachyon Corporation's superior shielding, the Seilch Railgun was developed with the intent of wearing down even the strongest shield generators at great range. It's unique charged shells make it rather expensive to mount, but many captains consider it well worth the price; electromagnetic interference, carefully tuned to force even the strongest shield generators absorb the hit as if they had no efficiency advantage at all.  ",,,,

orks,FACTION,"Emerging from the obscure fringes of the expansive Persean Sector, the Bultach Coalition traces its origins back to the waning days of the Domain Era. Tempted by the promises extended by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the forebears of the Coalition and their people migrated to their current home system, unwittingly stepping into a web of clandestine arrangements. Within the research facilities of Tri-Tachyon, they endured years of harrowing genetic experimentation and other enigmatic trials—many of which remain shrouded in secrecy, concealed from public knowledge or documented only in the most minuscule detail.

Those cast aside by society were often swallowed by the shadows, continuing the covert project. With the onset of the Great Collapse, the local Tri-Tachyon government abandoned all pretenses of concealing these experiments from the general populace, imposing unrelenting martial law upon the system's citizens.

This ill-conceived decision proved to be Tri-Tachyon's undoing, for it was only after decades of enduring suffering that the people of Bultach mustered the strength to revolt against their corporate overlords. Through a bitter campaign that succeeded in expelling them from the system, swiftly followed by fortifying their planet to withstand any attempts at recapture, the Bultach Coalition emerged as a tenacious force, launching relentless strikes against Tri-Tachyon while staunchly defending their hard-won territory.

Though smaller in scale compared to other influential factions, their protracted feud with Tri-Tachyon persists to this day, publicly known as the Company War. In recent cycles, the Coalition has cautiously initiated trade with other powers within the Persean Sector—specifically those that share a mutual animosity towards their despised former megacorporation oppressors. The Bultach Coalition, driven by an unwavering determination to gain the upper hand, is renowned for their willingness to employ any means necessary, even if their more controversial methods are vehemently denied in the public eye, thanks to their close ties with the Hegemony.

Since its inception, the Coalition has established itself as an industrial powerhouse, ceaselessly churning out a relentless stream of vessels while diligently fortifying their primary system. By extending their welcome to both common spacers and adherents of the Luddic faith, who seek safety and stability in the face of their most detested adversary, the Bultach Coalition has experienced rapid expansion, enabling them to unleash vast industrial capabilities on an unprecedented scale.","Properly formed now, the Bultach Coalition now strikes at Tri-Tach at any chance they have, and fiercely defend their territory. But over time, they have slowly opened up trade with the other powers of the sector-- Mainly those that also find themselves at odds with the megacorporation.",,,

Quite far from the core worlds, the perfect grounds for Tri Tachyon to perform hidden experiments on the generally unaware populace. Post collapse, any attempts to keep this experimentation hidden were abruptly stopped, with the planet struck with pseudo-martial law. Genetic, biological, and chemical weapons and modifications wracked the population for years, building a boiling resentment in all but the richest inhabitants. When the megacorporation was stretched thin and at it's weakest during the first AI war, a massive revolt was launched from Dhachaigh. Destruction wracked both the streets and the space above for all but a year. In the end, the planet was wrenched from Tri Tachyon's grasp, a raging polity rising to become the Bultach Coalition in time.

For years to come, paranoia was rampant. Anyone loyal, or even sympathetic to the megacorporation was promptly put on trial, and either exiled, or executed. Military recruitment was at a massive high, with so many families seeking stability, allowing the young state to rapidly push outwards in it's home system to establish itself.",,,,

Heavy in valuable ores, it was an essential stepping stone for mining, and subsequent ship production.

Once organized, and military leaders placed in power, the moon began a massive output of ships.

It is to spearhead their assault against Tritachyon's planets, with the capability to reduce the surface of any colony to a sheet of glass solely on it's own. The vengeful spirit of a spiteful populace.

Doubling as a last resort, it presents the option to embark upon it as an ark ship, to carry a large chunk of the population to safe haven, should the Bultach Coalition's war come to that.

Of course, it is much too resource-draining and heavy in maintenance requirements for it to embark much at all. For now, it rests in orbit of their homeworld, valiantly defending it from any threats, should they come too near.
