Such technology was tightly controlled by the Domain prior to the Collapse, and few polities of the Persean Sector still know how to program these devices, much less manufacture them from scratch.

This one is encoded with officer training data from the 9th Domain Battlegroup. To grant a captain the Sword of the Fleet skill, apply the biochip to their ship from the drop-down menu at the top of the ship fitting window.",1

Connecting the core to the AI interface of an automated ship should see it repair its new ""body"" with the utmost clarity, before a shutdown sequence renders both the nanites and their controller utterly inert.

Industrial self replicating nanites were a tightly controlled technology even during the height of the Domain. The dangers of programming errors or deliberate sabotage causing an omniphage cascade were ever present. If not for the stringent safety locks in place, this device would be more dangerous than the planetkiller you exchanged.

Apply by using the drop down menu in the ship refit screen. Will remove all d-mods from one automated hull of any origin.",1
