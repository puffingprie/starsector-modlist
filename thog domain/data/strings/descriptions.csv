thg_outpost,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Outpost was a relatively common drone carrier, known for deploying swarms of lighter craft alongside it's diverse, yet light, missile armament.",,,,
thg_charlatan,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Phase technology is a rare sight among domain drones, with the Charlatan-class being a notable exception. It was one of the first vessels to employ the archaic ring-cloak system in an even further unrefined state than the ubiquitous Gremlin, as there was no need for specialized P-space shielding owing to the vessel's lack of an organic crew. They are not exceptional phase vessels by any modern standard and lack the ability to cloak in idle P-space, but are often employed en masse owing to the great ease of their production.",,,,
thg_kilt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

One of the larger vessels to have ever made use of the archiac gremlin phase system, the Kilt-class is generally considered superior to the smaller, and slightly cheaper, Charlatan-class phase drone. However, it pays for it's marginally thicker armor plating and greater weapon compartmentalization with lower speed, while still sharing the same exceptionally unstable prototype cloak coil.",,,,
thg_castellan,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A massive logistical supply ship fielded in spaces occupied by more well-developed explorarium autofactories, the Castellan is a- relatively speaking - miniaturized auto-foundry, supply depot, and survey ship all compacted into one. Though not explicity designed as a combat drone, it is heavily armed and armored nonetheless so as to survive intense asteroid-cracking operations and to provide support to defensive fleets which often times accompany it.",,,,
thg_canteen,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Oft seen as a Castellan writ small, the Canteen is a compact, highly effecient mobile drone logistics vessel, equipped with a compact sensor suite and spacious cargo holds for supplying fuel and repairs to a greater autonomous fleet.",,,,
thg_luncheon,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A small, yet extremely effecient autonomous supply drone, fitted with a decently-sized cargo hold and capacious fuel tanks, meant to supply modest autonomous domain fleets for relatively long periods of time.",,,,
thg_bulkhead,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

An odd sight among domain explorarium fleets, the Bulkhead is - unlike the much, much more common Ox - an exceptionally effecient, entirely autonomous drive-field tug vessel. These were often times employed among armadas of drone surveyors as they traveled the stars via realspace, boosting the otherwise rather sluggish great autofoundries across the cosmos. Also unlike the Ox, the Bulkhead carries a light, yet respectable arms package, as even it would be expected to fulfill a assault role should it be deemed necessary by the greater autonomous fleet.",,,,
thg_macahuitl,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Considered by many to be unusually refined for a derelict vessel, the Maucahuitl is one of the few explorarium drones which is capable of effective flight both in and out of atmosphere. During times of conflict, great masses of these drones would fill the orbit of revolting nations, employing mass-bombing and precision strikes against the rebellious masses. In space, they're quite fragile, but pack a nasty punch in an exorbinantly nimble package.",,,,
thg_fisticuff,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A no-nonsense design of combat drone, consisting of a large array of ammunition feed systems and munition stores neatly tucked away inside of a well-armored shell.",,,,
thg_deadbolt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The larger brother of the Fisticuff drone, the Deadbolt fields notably heavier armament with slightly thicker armor and an even wider-spread Flak canister system, though all at the cost of speed, manueverability and all but the tiniest of cargo-capable crevices within the drone's hull.",,,,
thg_subjugator,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A true menace of a heavy drone cruiser, the subjugator is capable of employing it's substantial arms package with great effeciency, utilizing it's primitive Orion device to close the gap between itself with great speed.",,,,
thg_Century,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Bearing a striking resemblence to one of the Domain's eldest capital designs, the Century bears a powerful forward armament, as well as incredible mobility for it's size thanks to it's integrated Orion device.",,,,
thg_Paradigm,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A hulking, capital-sized combat drone carrier, the Paradigm is unique among Domain Explorarium craft in it's ability to field a wide variety of both ballistic and energy-based weaponry, as well as carrying a generous missile complement. A jack of all trades and truly a master of none, this humongous autonomous vessel excells at utilizing it's weaponry to support it's dedicated fighter wings on the front line with the help of it's integrated damper field, but it's armor fails to hold up under concentrated, sustained firepower compared to other large derelicts of the Explorarium's design.",,,,
thg_leper,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. This particular design, however, bears no commonality to any recorded Domain Explorarium blueprints. Rather, it is the result of a corrupted explorarium mobile manufactory nanoforge, which lies at the heart of the machine, constantly building upon itself for reasons unknown. This leviathan of a ramshackle drone ship thus bristles with weaponry and a variety of sub-systems found on many smaller craft, though little in the way of cohesive thought seems to have gone into it's superstructure's construction, leading to a wide variety of questionably usefully placed weapon slots and sub-par overall effeciency.",,,,
thg_Helmsman,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A Heavy destroyer-sized drone, the Helmsman holds an impressive forward-facing missile-centric armament along with bulky armor plating, but it offers little in the way of point defense, leaving it particularly vulnerable to flanking. Still, it's capacious hull is capable of housing a low-grade missile autoloader, providing it with substantial heavy firepower in prolonged engagements.",,,,
thg_speedbump_core,SHIP,"An extremely unorthodox drone. IFF feedback reports three seperate frigate-sized vessels rather than a singular Destroyer, as one might expect; this is because the Speedbump utilizes three entirely seperate flux systems and targeting control AIs in it's construction, enabling it to effectively engage three targets at once, and split it's individually sub-par flux capacity and systems capabilities into a formidable complex - yet compact, and surprisingly effecient - weapons array.",,,,
thg_Kingdom,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Kingdom-class Droneship is a gargantuan, mobile drone-ship microfoundry, capable of producing virtually infinite swarms of various fighter-sized drones with which to project power over entire planets, if not entire star systems thanks to it's heavy armor and massive arms package.",,,,
thg_Moat,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Moat-class Droneship is a massive, lopsided drone-ship battlecarrier, carrying with it tremendously thick armor plating and a powerful forward armament.",,,,
thg_rumble,SHIP,"A cruel, exceedingly large fighter drone which - to the jargan of many, many rebellious figures - carries a full-sized Jackhammer hammer torpedo launcher, which it employs with great effeciency thanks to it's use of a miniaturized primitive gremlin phase coil. Furthermore, it's integrated dual-barreled machine gun and - for a bomber craft - relative hull integrity allow it to withstand a healthy dosage of point defense fire without faltering.",,,,

thg_lout,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Louse-class drone is an oddity - without the necessity to account for factors such as a living crew and assosciated accomodations, reinforcements and pre-requisite hull modifications for installing an archaic Orion device on a destroyer-sized vessel became exceedingly practical, allowing this small war drone to act as a vanguard, leaping forward to the front line to engage faster targets while greater drone fleets would be deployed behind in tandem.",,,,
thg_pickle,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

An oddly, yet aptly, named cruiser-sized drone dropship, the Pickle was designed to be deployed in low-orbit of rebellious systems in order to lay down an oppressive ammount of firepower with it's broadside armaments.",,,,
thg_absolver,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Considered by many to bear a wide-variety of similarities to the ubiquitous Apogee exploration vessel - not least of which being a suite of high-quality sensory systems - the Absolver is a truly utilitarian drone, capable of both auxillary support functions as well as easily fitting the role of a front-line carrier.",,,,
thg_PParadigm,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

An experimental form of drone capital ship, featuring a large array of ineffecient ring phase coils in an attempt to make a phase-capable autonomous battlecarrier. The resulting ship is a nightmare to face in battle.",,,,
thg_reaver,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

There are elements of standard droneships within the hull structure, but they are covered by malevolently angled glacises and illogical tangles of conduit. Surely this monstrous vessel is the product of some deranged Domain naval architect, or a production chip corrupted by exposure to kilolights of faulty drive field? Regardless, the drone features modern phase coils - an extremely unusual sight on what should be an Explorarium drone, which makes it a true nightmare to face in combat.",,,,
thg_nachzehrer,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

There are elements of standard droneships within the hull structure, but they are covered by malevolently angled glacises and illogical tangles of conduit. Surely this monstrous vessel is the product of some deranged Domain naval architect, or a production chip corrupted by exposure to kilolights of faulty drive field? This particular drone features extremely advanced technological components, readings of which give off unusually high REM feedback, much akin to designs of even less certain origin.",,,,
thg_jury,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A light drone carrier, the Jury is oriented more for front-line combat than rear-echelon support, thanks to it's decent armor and substantial arms package.",,,,
thg_billiard,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The billiard is often thought to resemble the questionably utilitous Mudskipper Mk.II configuration, though writ to a far more practical standard. Not having to account for any organic amendities allows the compact hull to hold a properly-sized flux core and requisite ammunition feed systems to properly support either a large ballistic or missile mounting, giving this drone deceptively practical use in a support or light bombardment role.",,,,
thg_Oculus,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Heavily armed and decently armored, the Oculus can serve as either a venerable support or dedicated strike vessel in drone fleet armadas, thanks to it's 360 degree large ballistic slot and array of lighter armaments.",,,,
thg_Oracle,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A variation on the more common Oculus, the Oracle-class Phase Drone swaps the heavier armament of it's brother for a more dynamic medium mounting, in order to account for the increased flux costs of integrating a low-grade phase ring coil. It furthermore forgoes the facilities necessary for reserve missile capacity in favor of a low-grade phase skimmer.",,,,
thg_revetment,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A heavily armored space-tank of a cruiser, the Revetment features both generous hull plating coupled with five thick shock plating modules in order to absorb a hail of gunfire on the frontlines. However, it may struggle to reach those front lines with effeciency, and often finds itself prone to flanking due to it's terrible point defense array, though it is at least supported by it's ability to carry a single wing of drone fighters.",,,,
thg_cyclopian,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A complex autonomous sensory system node encased in thick armor, the Cyclopian bears with it a relatively heavy missile-centric armament, along with a complex EMP discharge array which, while highly vulnerable to damage, allows it to disable and destroy entire fleets of fighter craft on it's own. This makes it a venerable support ship, though when caught on it's own it is quite susceptible to flanking owing to it's relatively poor manueverability.",,,,
thg_cubit,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Quite possibly one of the least remarkable drones ever to be utilized by the Domain Explorarium, the Cubit is, as its name may imply, incredibly squarish. It's capacious little hull holds a remarkably compact ammunition feed system for it's central turret, leaving ample space to pack enough supply to support a small floatilla of autonomous craft for modest extended periods of time.",,,,
thg_gauche,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

An unsightly hull, the Gauche sports a vast complex of autonomous microfabs and forges required to field a venerable armada of fighter-sized dronecraft, along with a sophisticated - for explorarium standards - sensory and command array in order to properly coordiante and support them. It's missile armament, though not excessive, is nothing to sneeze at either.",,,,
thg_slasher,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A robust and aggressive light hull, the Slasher boasts a large, light-mount oriented armament in a swift, decently armored package, which coupled with it's integrated burn drive makes it most apt at chasing down and destroying other small vessels.",,,,
thg_obligation,SHIP,"A heavily armored, bulky explorarium drone which barely fits in the confines of standard-sized fighter bays, nigh-on rivaling the ssize - and armaments - of some light frigates. It's not exorbinantly agile, but it packs an exceptionally nasty punch, and can take a beating itself to boot.",,,,
thg_barracuda,SHIP,"An exceptionally swift, well-protected autonomous bomber much akin to the more common Piranha bomber, though utilizing a more reliable - though lower yielding - payload of Breach SRMs. Though fewer craft fit in a wing owing to the size of the Barracuda, it's exceptional swiftness coupled with it's point defense capabilities and autonomous nature make any potential losses more easily absorbed.",,,,
thg_chamberlain,SHIP,"The chamberlain serves as a primarily utility drone in explorarium fleets, providing a compact mining platform for asteroid cracking operations in order to garner more resources for autofab facilities. However, it serves secondarily as a decent strike vessel, thanks to it's built-in mining laser and single hammer-class torpedo.",,,,
thg_knuckle,SHIP,"A small drone based upon an archaic manned fighter design, though with notably thicker armor plating in lieu of the need to harbor a pilot. Though simple, the Knuckle is exceptionally survivable thanks to it's good combination of mobility and armor, and it's light yet versatile armament is well suited for engaging a wide variety of light targets, especially when deployed en masse.",,,,
thg_key,SHIP,"Key-class drones are miniscule in comparison to the bulk of craft employed by the Domain Explorarium, featuring very little in the way of armor and armament. However, they are extremely fast, highly manueverable, and stupendously easily mass-produced as a result, lending toward them being used in gross excess aboard a variety of Explorarium carriers, often times overwhelming craft through raw numbers as opposed to through individual firepower.",,,,
thg_bumblebee,SHIP,"A truly nasty autonomous drone interceptor, originally designed to provide the domain with an autonomous fighter craft capable of wiping out entire fighter fighter screens by their lonesome, thanks to their rear-mounted Cricket SRM launchers and wide-angle vulcan turrets. They are extremely effective in this regard, though suffer from a rather lengthy replacement and rearment time owing to their - for an explorarium drone - rather complex assembly.",,,,
thg_trencher,SHIP,"An extremely unorthodox fighter, let alone by Domain Explorarium standards. The Trencher utilizes a miniaturized prototype gremlin phase system, combined with a rather nasty armament of dual-mounted double-barreled LMGs and an axial light mortar. The Trencher is exorbinantly nimble, yet rather fragile, making for a great pursuit and harassment vessel for occupying opposing point defense and shield systems, though it struggles to deal a killing blow on any but the smallest craft on it's own.",,,,
thg_pachinko,SHIP,"One of the tiniest drones still capable of being slotted into a standard LPC, the Pachinko is virtually little more than a shell of metal fitted with the barest of drone componentry, forged in Explorarium green-and-yellow. This tiny disc of a drone carries a mining-grade laser and virtually no armor, though it's exceptional agility combined with it's virtually instantaneous replacement capacity makes it at least an annoynace for enemy PD emplacements and fighters.",,,,
thg_thistle,WEAPON,"An ancient form of point defense weaponry, the Thistle-class point defense cannon is, in essence, the smaller brother of the more ubiquitous modern vulcan. Though it boasts considerably lower damage per second, the simplicity of it's single ammo feed allows for easier mounting, and the lessened recoil lends toward a slightly greater effective range.",,,,
thg_zhuge,WEAPON,"The archiac analog of the much more refined Mark IX Autocannon, the Zhuge utilizes an overly complex loading system combined with a - for it's size - over-powered kinetic munition, leading to poor flux effeciency and terrible accuracy under prolonged fire, which combined with it's sub-par recoil dampener system lends toward poor accuracy at the otherwise long ranges which it is able to achieve. It is spared largely by the ease of it's installation, as the undersized (and underperforming) components fit compactly despite their over-engineered nature largely within the turret itself.",,,,
thg_micropulse,WEAPON,"Essentially a scaled-down Autopulse laser, the Micropulse predates it's larger brother by a notable margin, hailing from an epoch of lower voltage super-capacitors and discharge arrays. It is overall less effecient than larger, more modern alternatives, but still excells in a strike role for vessels capable of handling it's immense flux costs.",,,,
thg_cricket,WEAPON,"The smaller cousin of the more infamous Locust SRM, the Cricket utilzes a much more compact ammunition bank and feed system linked to a considerably smaller multiple launch pod, allowing for incredible anti-fighter capabilities in an extremely convenient package.",,,,
thg_cricket_fighter,WEAPON,"An even lighter version of the Cricket SRM launcher integrated into the hull of the Bumblebee drone, it trades a capacious ammo store for a fighter-sized missile autofab, allowing for continuous point defense capability in prolonged engagements without the need for refitting.",,,,
thg_laggard,WEAPON,"An archaic link between the Light Assault Gun and the Light Mortar, the Laggard Automortar utilizes an outdated ammo feed system in order to facilitate rapid firing of light mortar munitions, granting improved strike ability when compared to more traditional mortar designs in exchange for slightly worse flux effeciency and reduced prolonged accuracy and performance.",,,,
thg_mallet,WEAPON,"The only marginally older predecessor to the Jackhammer, the Mallet shares the same six-torpedo feed capacity as the faster-firing triple-feed analog, but utilizes a simpler mechanism to load and fire one torpedo at a time for smaller-scale asteroid cracking operations. While less suitable for use as an improvised strike weapon, it's a little easier to mount as a result.",,,,
thg_smex,WEAPON,"A miniaturized rotary precursor to the modern Assault gun, the Sprinkler rotary strike cannon is an exceptionally high volume-of-fire anti-armor strike weapon fitted in an extremely compact yet flux-ineffecient package, limited largely only by it's archaic limited ammo feed system and use of a very light explosive munition. Regardless of these downfalls and it's succession by simpler assault gun designs, it is still an extremely effective strike weapon both for and against lighter craft.",,,,
thg_rotaryk,WEAPON,"The oft-forgotten precursor to the Assault Chaingun, the Rotary Kinetic Cannon works off of a similar principle, though with fewer barrels and firing solid kinetic slugs as opposed to explosive micromunitions. The resulting weapon is largely akin to a souped-up heavy machine gun, though it loses it's targeting priority against light vehicles in favor of laying down overwhelming firepower against even up to mid-grade shield generators, thanks to it's overwhelming volume of fire in bursts. However, for prolonged use, the age of it's autofeed system begins to tell as it's rate of fire is brought from a sprint to a crawl as it's ammo feeds slowly restock from cached munitions.",,,,
thg_rotaryklrg,WEAPON,"In an attempt to maximize the strengths of the Rotary Kinetic Cannon prior to the development of the more modern Assault Chaingun, the dual-mounted Rotary Kinetic Cannon utilizes a larger, slightly more effecient ammo feed system along with boasting an essentially doubled rate of fire, lending to an overall shorter firing life but a greater rate of sustained firepower and more concentrated strike bursts for quickly overwhelming all but the largest of shield generators, and applying continuous pressure to those which fail to fall under it's withering hail of firepower.",,,,
thg_punji,SHIP,"A lightweight, decently armored and rather sleekly packaged autonomous explorarium drone, fielding the fearsome, yet archaic Sprinkler rotary auto cannon as it's primary - and only - armament. It is both highly effective at effectively engaging and destroying light craft such as frigates and other fighters thanks to it's great manueverability, use of a flare system and the strike power of it's armament, as well as highly capable at harassing larger vessels.",,,,
thg_lockbox,SHIP,"An unorthodox Von Neumann combat drone, both easily fabricated in a standard fighter LPC itself, as well as capable of producing key-class saturation drones to support itself and other drone fighters at great distances. Quite effective at occupying enemy PD systems for prolonged periods of time.",,,,
