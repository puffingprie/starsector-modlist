  "description": "A wide variety of shittily kitbashed domain derelict explorarium drones, compacted into a mod for your pl*yer convenience. Also includes a small spattering of weapons, and a less-small spattering of domain-derelict drone fighters. This mod does NOT do anything fancy such as add roaming explorarium fleets or stations on it's own, so i recommend you use another mod in tandem that does.",
