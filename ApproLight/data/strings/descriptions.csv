ApproLight01,CUSTOM,"A planet perfectly transformed covered in a toxic atmosphere. This colony used to be a part of the Hegemony but was taken away by the Tri-Tachyon Corperation and its ownership is still controversial. Under the toxic purple atmosphere, various sealed metropolises are spread across the landscape. The economy of the planet is well developed. The quality of the food and housing is impressive. Nowadays it is a stronghold for the Spectre Nexus, the core department of the Appro-Light Council and the Council's leader, Truth Originem, resides here. Many secretive meetings are held at these strongholds. The Borken Foundation's proprietary facilities, the XI Crystal Aperature, are spread across every city allowing the cities to maintain their way of life.",,"Since the forceful takeover by Tri-Tachyon, the planet has been in a state of controversy. Patriotic fervor erupted as a result of the invasion, and bloodshed often erupted between farmers who supported Tri-Tachyon and city dwellers who were drawn in by the Appro-Light Council. On top of that, the local population is extremely isolated and almost half of the crimes are linked to deep-rooted xenophobic traditions. You see a message repeated on various signs: ""To all independent mercenaries. You are not welcome here. Like it or not, it's your fault."" You suddenly feel very uneasy, and decide to either quickly leave or land, before the Appro-Light patrols make up some excuse to arrest you.",
AL_planet_flameForge,CUSTOM,"An abandoned industrial desert planet. The surface is covered with abandoned facilities and countless habitation domes.
Supposedly many large scale accidents have occured here but the Council remains secretive on such matters. Looking out into the distance there seem to be large holes in the surface that draw the sands into the darkness like a black hole. The desert still holds many secrets, it seems.",,,
AL_planet_imeatheus,CUSTOM,"A militarized mechanical surveillance station originally deployed by the Hegemony in this system, the domain of Ouroboros. But the moment Lin Ouroboros swore allegiance to the Speaker, the planet, which was comparable to a planetary fortress, came under the rule of the Appro-Light Council ever since.

The fortress was named ""Star Circumnavigator"" by the Hegemony. The planet's original traces are still visible, but they are just a few miniature experimental fields scattered among the steel coverings, and even the planet's core has long since been replaced by a K-2 planetary drive.",,A towering enclosure made of an unknown metal blocks the view of all prying eyes. The officers on station give you disquieting looks; it seems that they don't receive visitors often.,
AL_planet_acupuncturePoint,CUSTOM,"A planet that nobody cares about. There are a few pirates living here. When the Appro-Light Council entered the system a burst fog signal generator was set up between the planet and the star leaving the pirates unaware of the council.

AL_unosStation,CUSTOM,"The space station that Ouroboros built when he defected. It is now a massive prison for both the Holy Seeker and Godship, and also a place for the Speaker to conduct non-discriminatory negotiations. The Speaker comes here regularly every month, and almost all the ships in the station are filled with people who want to see him. However, it's questionable if the ""Speaker"" they see is truly himself.",,"You stare at the huge space station, which looks very small compared to the nearby planet, with a feeling of inexpressible shock.",
AL_station_port_Julius,CUSTOM,"This station on the outskirts of the system is the seat of the Grand Duke Julius. With an Appro-Light guard at every airlock and major compartment, as well as multiple battleships resident in the giant dock, this station is undoubtedly one of the most secure locations in the Sector. In addition to hangars, fuel tanks, grain silos, and battery packs, there are plenty of recreational facilities to satisfy the needs of the council's upper echelons, with the Old City especially known for its colorful nightlife.",,"You step onto the connecting bridge of the dock platform and can already see the inner portion of the station radiating multiple large, colorful lights. Although it is still at least five kilometers away, a symphonic sound that you cannot recall the name of is coming from a building not far away, and wonder if this station is even more prosperous than rumored.",
AL_station_tri_detect,CUSTOM,An aquatic space station established by the Tri-Tachyon corporation.

approlight,FACTION,"After the Collapse, at the end of the First AI War, a small group of Tri-Tachyon employees accidentally discovered a technological black box during an expedition towards the Orion-Perseus Abyss, the main content of which was the specifications for a ""Deuterium-Antideuterium Reactor""; in addition to some conceptual technical data with mysterious alien technology that was seemingly incompatible with this universe's laws of physics. The employees agreed that none of them would report the discovery to their superiors, and formed the ""Illuminati"" to begin parsing it in cooperation with some of the artificial intelligences that had secretly and illegally left the corporation's network. Their progress was extraordinarily slow at first, but after decades, the ""original man"", Truth Originem, joined and gave a major boost to their research - behind the scenes, of course.

During this long period of time, some of the members of the Illuminati rose in their careers, became rising stars among Tri-Tachyon's employees, and even took to the political arena. By coincidence, Truth Originem, who was caught in the political upheaval, ending up becoming the CEO of the Danae Project, which was the ostensible leader of the Libra Accord Committee, transferring all of the Illuminati's resources to the Agustin system. But Truth Originem's ambition went beyond Tri-Tachyon's imagination: with the assistance of some insurrectionists, he colluded with Ouroboros, the former governor of a Hegemony colony and original partner of the Danae Project, to take advantage of the stalemate after the Second AI war and sever the group's relationship with Tri-Tachyon. The ambitious regime known as the Appro-Light Council was quietly created overnight, and with the support of their allies, the Foundation of Borken, became a truly powerful dictatorship with highly sophisticated technology.",,,
immortallight,FACTION,"A disastrous organization formed as the result of contamination caused by the ""Fallen Gods"", and has been expanding its forces by contaminating and brainwashing the Appro-Light Council's fleets and ship personnel who are unable to retreat from the meatgrinder of both their forces and the Blade of Conviction. It's worth noting that most of the Appro-Light Council's citizens are entirely unaware of these battles; it's mildly intriguing to see how the council's upper echelons are classifying the information.

They utilize the rift in spacetime known as the Chaos Rift as their base; as determined by the wreckage of Immortal-Light fleets, it's highly likely that they perform fleet maintenance through the utilization of the Supreme Light factory located within the rift. Keel Higgs, of the Blade of Conviction, claims that they're stationed at the rift in anticipation of some ominous astral phenomenon called the ""Chaos Opening"", which will ""light the Holy Beacon"".

Immortal-Light, in a manner befitting their chaotic creation, are not a unified whole. Due to data recovered from the ship computers of disabled Immortal-Light ships, it can be concluded that the organization is divided into two separate factions based on their form of life: the ""Immortal Wisdom"" consisting of powerful artificial intelligences and the ""Immortal Cult"" composed of brainwashed councilors. However, due to the lack of a central governing body, their actions are at best aimless and disorganized, which is one of the reasons why they have not embarked on any particularly aggressive military operations.

Almost all survivors of battles with Immortal-Light have been left with trauma that always requires some time to heal; and without exception, those afflicted uniformly quote the following verse shortly after recovery:

All are truths, All are gods.
All will be taken, All will change the light and expel the darkness.
The end of All, eternal and bright.

During one of the council civil wars the blueprint of the ship was acquired by Lin Ouroboros, one of the most trusted subordinates of Truth Originem. Without the blueprint the rebellion was ceased and the rebels were executed. The Appro-Light Scholar class ship is usually used for blitzkrieg tactics with the excellent mobility and ship systems which can further improve engine performance. It is capable of performing many roles well. It's best strategy is to charge towards the enemies and launch torpedoes at close range which is very effective but also a bit too aggressive. Almost all the captains serve on Approlight Scholar class ships have a habit of writing a will and testament before battle due to the unforunate end they meet when performing such tactics.",,,

Designated ""A.L.S.S"", a light battleship, it is the final and strongest work of the project headed by the Speaker. Compared with other battlecruisers, the A.L.S.S. is the winner of the battlefield with its superior flux performance by focusing on supporting its large weapon array and ignoring small weapons.

Although it is a so-called light battleship, its effective firepower and defense performance are much stronger than those of ordinary capital ships: in addition to its superior flux system, its Deuterium Reactor and tactical system complement each other perfectly, illustrating that something can be more than the sum of its parts. With its large weapon array facing almost completely forward, its frontal firepower output can overshadow a large number of conventional capital ships. If not for the fact that it is relatively easy to disable after it loses its shields, the A.L.S.S. would have forever set the standard for the council's ships.

Unfortunately, while the A.L.S.S. still serves in Appro-Light's fleets, the original prototypes used to carry experimental Prime Flame Clan weapons have gradually disappeared; it's rumored that the Speaker's personal flagship was one of those prototypes.",,,

However most of the Appro-Light captains can clearly see that the Scholar of Iniquity is inspired by other ALS variants based on the materials and hull shapes. It's possible that her designer was cutting corners when the blueprints were being drawn but these do nothing for Tenshi's love for her.

It is rumored that the original designer said that ""the Textbook was awesome"". Somehow this seems to be nothing more than an urban legend.",,,
AL_scholar_F,SHIP,"The ""elite"" model of the Appro-Light Scholar is actually the original version, designed as a heavy strike ship; but after the completion of the research and development of that role, the cost was found to be astronomical. The design was abandoned and turned into the light cruiser seen today. The only remaining hulls from this experiment are known as the ""Franklin-class"".

This type of hull has four dual Igniter-class torpedo launchers built in. One volley can destroy almost all small and medium-sized ships. Compared to traditional Appro-Light Scholar, it's more aggressive, but has a longer wait on its torpedoes being ready. As a last resort, a Franklin can use its skimmer to place in itself in the middle of the enemy fleet, as a one-time assault.

In fact, the Franklin-classes have been gone for a long time. At least for now, Appro-Light's Spectre Nexus has been unable to find the ship for sale.",,,
AL_archimedes,SHIP,"The Archimedes was received much better than the Franklin-class, which was also a variant of the Appro-Light Scholar. The ship was born several years after the Euclid-class battleships were commissioned: using the Euclid and Scholar as a base, the Spirit team successfully modified the latter into the Archimedes for use in special operations. Initially, it served as a small number of elite ships, but after gradually showing its strength on the battlefield, everyone realized the power of the ship. By reducing the ship configuration and cutting costs, the Archimedes class began to operate as a rarer class of conventional ships.

The Archimedes lacks the built-in Igniter launchers of the standard Scholar; instead opting for an increased number of modular missile mounts to provide support. The flexible mounts allow it to support with saturation missiles, strike with torpedoes, or mount energy weapons to increase its sustainability. The special Moon Arc missile enhancement modification exclusively enhances the medium missile mount in the middle of the ship, making the Archimedes' battle plan focus on the weapon installed there.

""All of you Archimedes users are traitors to the Scholar! Heretics!"" On some obscure forum, the captains known as Scholar Fundamentalists abhorred the Archimedes; probably because their beloved Igniter torpedoes were abandoned.

AL_assistance,SHIP,"A by-product of the ""Appro-Light Project"", a masterpiece of one of the mercenaries that Jormungand commanded. Although not all blueprints and ships were designed by them, it is not a brand new unique ship. The prototype is based on the heavy phase ships of the distant pre-Collapse era, and it was a great success with his advice and experiments. Unfortunately, in the days shortly after the ""Appro-Light Project"" was officially declared dead, the mercenary died in a massive attack that destroyed the file documenting his exploits. The Assistant-class is larger than usual phase frigates because it is equipped with specially designed flux conduits and can be used as a small cargo ship in times of financial need.

The Assistant's superiority lies in its superior defensive power compared to ordinary frigates and its specially designed tactical system. This allows it to survive and support friendly ships with a solid position in large-scale battles. Its tactical system is able to transmit its own flux to the surrounding targeted ships through a quantum tunneling method. This makes the Assistant as formidable as the cunning Afflictor in capital ship engagements.",,,

AL_textbook,SHIP,"The early days of the council's fleet relied on such small hulls to carry cargo. Because of their low manufacturing cost and large numbers, high ranking council officials often hid on one of the Textbooks in the Grand Fleet to avoid enemy sniping at the flagship, and this proved to be effective.

After the rise of the Scolder and Granary classes, the Textbook gradually became a backup shuttle bay and was also used as a place for private parties. The Speaker's senior officer, Jormungand, apparently approved of this new purpose .

AL_penciller,SHIP,"These early experimental hulls of the ""Appro-Light Project"" were equipped with a special ""tearing"" teleportation technology, which has the effect of quickly skimming through phase space and causing delayed rift creation. The prototype for this technology was derived from the Boson-class phase destroyer designed by the same group, and was in a sense a smaller version for less cost.

In designing this class of ship, the Spirit team used the most experienced architects and design scientists. Living up to expectations, the Calligrapher-class was born. This frigate was able to move around the battlefield with abandon and use all types of weapons to use in support of a fleet. Needless to say, it was one of the most outstanding small ships the Spirit team designed. It is a pity that its operational difficulty and ""unique"" aesthetics make it difficult to be widely accepted.",,,

On the official social media platform of the Appro-Light Council, the only thing that can be found is the fiction novel written by some enthusiast for this ship, which is called ""Viva Sandra"".",,,
,,,,,
AL_whitewolf,SHIP,"The early retrofit ships of the ""Appro-Light Project"" were heavily based on the internal structure of common phase ships, and were equipped with special jump systems to accommodate long-range flanking maneuvers.

The White Wolf is designed around a split-second jump system, with a highly integrated time-travel unit. The principle of this system is closely related to P-space, flashing to a designated location will stimulate time displacement at the same time, returning the overall structure of the ship to the state of one second ago.

In the eyes of the council, the White Wolf is the assassin and mainstay of the fleet, with an extremely high margin of error in the battlefield. But if a crew could choose which ship they could serve on, they would not choose a White Wolf. According to reliable data, the incidence of psychological disorders among the crew of White Wolves is extremely high, and it is speculated that the jump system has caused some of the crew's time perception to be seriously disturbed. A bounty hunter who tried to escape a White Wolf once described the class as follows when he was finally arrested: ""You can never guess where it will be next.""",,,
AL_boson,SHIP,"The Boson-class, a genius design, has been described as ""a reproduction of the universe's fundamental nature"" and ""the most successful use of phase space"". As a phase destroyer, her performance does not look impressive on paper, but in fact has a high tactical value. When the Boson dives into P-space, it causes a temporal dislocation, thus leaving an afterimage that is about one second behind the Boson at the location where the ship dives. When the Boson resurfaces, this imaginary image will be quickly corrected by space-time and return to the position where the boson is currently located, and the path passed will generate huge amount of EMP-esque effects due to the space misalignment. The Boson's tactical system can lock the position of an enemy ship within its range, and use phase space as the medium to emit energy that transcends space-time, ""leap"" multiple times at the same point in time, and strike all enemy ships within its range in a very short time.

This warship is one of the most advanced in the history of Appro-Light. In the early days of the social unrest of the Council, the madman who had successfully copied the blueprints of the Doom-class phase cruiser accidentally revealed his position, and many of the higher council members on one of the planets of the Council learned of this and fell into fear of the political crisis that might come afterwards. At that time some Tri-Tachyon personnel thus clashed with those of the Hegemony staying at Imeatheus, because the blueprint owner named Joseph had sold the blueprint of the phase ship to the Hegemony at a low price. But obviously, the council was repulsed by this kind of in-fighting and entrusted Joseph with the task of developing the Boson-class phase destroyer, while everyone involved in the conflict were put in confinement for half a year.",,,
AL_bachelor,SHIP,"It is one of the core hulls of the ""Appro-Light Project"" and had a significant role in the project. It is a highly sophisticated destroyer that has been used to protect classified information for years.

The Bachelor-class is a prominent star in the Council's small and medium-sized fleets. The Bachelor is the top destroyer in the Council, both in terms of technology and battlefield utility. Many captains have compared it to a destroyer version of the Keter, because it has excellent defensive capabilities while carrying a good amount of firepower, like that ship.

The special multi-dimensional turbulence shield uses a secret technology that cannot be replicated, which manifests itself by projecting a stable inert substance into the material dimension by special means. Although these substances do not stop enemy fire spatially, as the Bachelor's name suggests, they can act like artificial intelligence to reduce enemy damage by analyzing the rate of energy propagation in order to dissipate said energy. In addition to this, the powerful maneuvering system makes the ship itself suitable for any high-intensity combat. Additionally, the Spirit team has adapted a dimensional differential generator to further enhance the Bachelor's defensive capabilities. With its powerful energy weapons, the Bachelor is one of the best destroyers.",,,
AL_scolder,SHIP,"A modified freighter developed during the middle stages of the ""Appro-Light Project"". It has large cargo capacity and is able to carry multiple weapon systems into combat.

AL_referee,SHIP,"An early retrofitted design of the ""Appro-Light Project"". Most of the early hulls were built from scraps left over from the more prominent and popular prototype designs, but rigorous quality control ensured even these repurposed leftovers maintained A-class performance. With two flight decks, a robust tactical system, and excellent flux statistics, the Judicator can easily hold its own on the front lines.

The Judicator was initially used for small-scale suppression operations, as it seemed that the ship's impact on large-scale battles, especially those fielding capital ships, would be negligible. But as time passed, the Judicator's mobility and defenses were gradually enhanced, and became widely-accepted as the council's light carrier option.",,,
AL_brain,SHIP,"The result of the ""Time Metamorphosis"" experiment, the masterpiece of the Appro-Light Council. It is the line ship that all captains dream of - a beautiful and indestructible line on the battlefield. The Intelligence-class line ship has been classified as a destroyer since... reasons, but its cost effectiveness is beyond most destroyers. The reason it can't be classified as a cruiser may simply be that its offensive performance is quite lackluster.

The Intelligence's integral AI core is powerful and intimidating; no one knows if it exceeds the limits of AI regulations. Its algorithm is unique, the computational efficiency is top-notch, and it can even direct the flow of flux to create strong electromagnetic interference, repelling missiles from all surrounding enemy ships, making it a lot of effort to hit not just the Intelligence, but the ships around it as well; in some cases, the missiles are completely harmless to the ship. As we all know, before the emergence of the Immortal-Light, every Intelligence carried varying amounts of the council's confidential information, probably because it was almost impossible to be sunk and the councilors figured they had nothing to worry about. But now, although the practice has not been discontinued completely (for some reason), not many people will store data on it anymore.

Of course, it is impossible to ignore the cross-shaped glow in the center. The mysterious power linking the branching hulls has caused countless captains who own the ship to call it - ""The First Thrusters"". This makes it a rather ironic ship to be used  by the atheistic council, but somehow, it appears in the database and dockyard with dignity, somehow, it ~(#! #God$%! Brain$%...&--

*Database has cut the link_",,,
AL_emptiness,SHIP,"This ship is a retrofit created in the middle of the ""Appro-Light Project"". The prototype of this ship was created by a scholar of a fallen race from a galaxy beyond the Milky Way, who is said to be under the command of Jormungandr. Although this scholar seems to be a human, he seems to have an unusually acute sense of time. After he led an all-Spirit team to dissect the blueprints of the warship with the Temporal Shell, and learned its principle of manipulating time from itself to the field, the Emptiness-class destroyer was born. While its unique Chronitron particle time field can affect all ships in a wide area, it can focus on allies through simple IFF protocols.

The Emptiness-class is good at getting stuck in at the center of the battlefield, and when the time stream force field is turned on, it can provide a significant boost to the surrounding friendly ships. This has led to the fact that no matter how large the fleet is, there is always a place for an Emptiness.",,,
AL_discipline,SHIP,"An early retrofitted ship created in the ""Appro-Light Project"". The prototype came from an abandoned blueprint for the Sunder-class destroyer. Originally it would have held a similar appearance to the Sunder, but the ship's designer altered its aesthetic to better suit their tastes.

The Discipline-class destroyer is often used for both direct assaults as well as raids. All captains who can control the Discipline have an indomitable spirit. In the same class, without other ship interference, a Discipline can be almost invincible. In particularly dangerous missions, such as sending a single ship to contain a cruiser, the Discipline can still be competent; and even if it fails, its alpha strike will be enough to cause most cruisers to be heavily damaged or even disabled. In short, the Discipline is considered Appro-Light's most aggressive ship, and many of the council's captains who prefer close-range brawling choose a Discipline as their flagship.

""Listen carefully to my wonderful Disciplines, you ignorant fools!"" A captain once screamed this so loudly at the enemy's flagship that he successfully executed a decapitation strike against all odds.",,,
AL_torch,SHIP,"The Sevengate is another masterpiece of Samuel Joseph, the ""Hand of Time"", who also designed the Boson-class phase destroyer. The core of the ship is designed with the magic number ""7"", which has incredible regenerative and ranged striking ability. Although its special energy-emitting core suffers from short term fatigue, it will not degrade after long periods of use, and the internal atomic structure will also undergo spontaneous resequencing, greatly enhancing the core's plasticity.

The Sevengate's energy strike system is called the ""Crystal Annihilation Charge"": diving into phase space and quickly repairing itself over a short period of time, causing spatial shock, and then exploding the energy accumulated from the phase space differential when surfacing to form a shock. This force that tears apart reality comes from the special crystals embedded in the inner walls of the ship, consisting of a special substance that spontaneously collapses at ultra-high temperatures to form gravitational distortions. The chain reaction of these crystals produces the Crystal Annihilation Charge effect, whose energy makes a rift in phase space, interrupting the space-time continuum, generating again a large amount of energy while retracing time, and the volume of space in which the effect takes place happens to encompass itself. This is the reason why the Crystal Annihilation Charge can be used indefinitely. Of course, this crystal also has a similar fatigue limit: it cannot trigger several times over a short period.

As a high-end destroyer, the scarcity of special crystals has led to there only being a handful of Sevengate-class ships in service. What's more, due to the defects of the early models in service, there were often accidents in which the ship disappeared after the crystal destruction was triggered by an overload in the middle of a battle: the cause was initially concluded to be that the space-time continuum could not be restored in time, resulting in the aftermath sending the ship and crew to a parallel timeline. Even though such problems have since been resolved, Appro-Light's military has reduced the priority for manufacturing the ship.",,,
,,,,,
AL_keter,SHIP,"A product of the same period as the Euclid-class battleships, the mainstay of the fleet, the treasure of an experienced captain.

It is worth mentioning that, unlike the Euclid, the Keter's design team was unknown and not actually part of the Appro-Light Project at first, but this carefully polished hull proved the designer's talent and led to the Ether group eagerly accepting them.

The Keter's overall design principle is to improve the fault tolerance rate, that is, to have an excellent defense, and through advanced slot modification, ensure its frontal firepower will not fall behind in spite of that. In terms of defense, the Keter has a shield with extremely high toughness, and the design team even gave up the deuterium reactor of the Ether team, and instead carried a dimensional difference generator, making it perfectly fit with the hull and play a role. Proving that something can be more than the sum of its parts, a Keter can stand still in the battlefield under the triple protection. Its unique built-in modification ""Oath of Thunder"" will sacrifice the output and ammunition stores of its weapons, but it can buffer the ship's flux to ensure system stability, and obtain excellent defensive performance in a high-flux state.

Excellent durability and good frontal firepower, all of which confirm the fact that it is the loyal sword and shield of the Appro-Light fleet, and has become the cruiser that has seen the most use throughout the council's history.",,,
AL_oilphaser,SHIP,"""WHAT HELL IS WRONG WITH THE COUNCIL?!"" shouted the chief designer of the Partiality-class freighter. ""IT'S A PHASE SHIP! WHY DO YOU MAKE IT A FREIGHTER!?"" However Truth Originem didn't give a damn about it.

AL_brain_attack,SHIP,"The final product of the ""Time Metamorphosis"" experiment. Although the powerful combat ship was highly appreciated by captains, there was hardly any report about it in the naval propaganda newspaper of the Appro-Light Council. The Sentience-class cruiser is based on the Intelligence-class line ship. It is loaded with the same level of AI core as the Intelligence, so its defense performance is impeccable. In terms of attack, it may be a little worse off than the other cruisers that Appro-Light have access to, but its powerful flux grid is enough to make up for this lack.

However, soon after the ""Time Transmutation"" event, the first signs of the Immortal-Light Front, the public suddenly found that the traitors' main fleet consisted primarily of Sentience-classes. A sense of fear descended on every captain who owned them, and the ship's popularity plummeted. Appro-Light and mercenary forces alike gave it the title: ""Cross of Betrayal"" and have blacklisted them from service.

Like the Intelligence-class the *God* shines upon it. The almighty *God* shares the power with it. The *God* wants it to be a representative. The *God* is endless, so it is said.

AL_postgraduate,SHIP,"A late ""Appro-Light Project"" retrofit of the many Eagle-class cruisers of ""midline"" tech, while remaining as highly maneuverable as ever. However, this modification was an unexpectedly illegal one, and its results were recognized by Jormungand before the perpetrators were imprisoned for a long time for plagiarism - illegally using the blueprints of the Bachelor's tactical system and completing this extremely dangerous modification on an incompatible tech base.

As soon as this ship was announced, it began to be found in every one of Appro-Light's autofactories, because of its ubiquity and cheapness. Although this retrofit sacrificed most of the Post Graduate's firepower, by studying the tactical systems of the Bachelor class, the newly installed system achieved an organic combination of absorbing damage and evasive maneuvering, making the Post Graduate's combat endurance almost comparable to that of a Keter-class cruiser. All things considered, the ship's survival rate and cost effectiveness are exceptionally high. Nonetheless, the Post Graduate's peak performance time is always an issue.",,,

The ship's unique modification called ""Oath Breaker"" allows all of its squadrons to gain an additional craft, and the special tactical adjustment system makes it an instant supercarrier alongside the Astral.

The ship caught the attention of the council's top brass soon after it was introduced and was quickly incorporated into the fleet. In the main fleet without the Academy-class, the low-maintenance, highly offensive Euclid became the sharpest blade. However, like the prototype, it lacked flexibility in its loadout and was slightly unwieldy in maneuvering, and these were the main points of criticism against it, among others. Nevertheless, this powerful full-fledged carrier did not steal the spotlight of its previous version, the Euclid-class battleship, probably because of the cost of converting one into the Euclid (M).",,,
AL_keter_m,SHIP,"If the A.L.S.S. is a battlefield killer, then the Keter (M)'s conversion must be winning all the time. The remodelled Keter cruiser came from private development after the ""Appro-Light Project"" ended. In less than a month it quickly become a first pick for the battlefield.

It's a simple, time tested design. In contrast to the original Keter model, the Keter (M)'s shields were sacrificed in favour of frontal firepower and maneuverability. The defensive Dimensional Difference Generator was replaced with a Deuterium Reactor to support the burst output and the ""Oath of Thunder"" was replaced with a turbo-generator called the ""Oath of Vower"". The engine draws kinetic energy from spatial distortions caused by changes in the gravitational field and emits the sound of rumbling thunder when it operates. The crew often has minor tinnitus due to the poor sound insulation of the Keter (M)'s modified hull material, however these problems are seen as very minor. The engine only needs to be periodically refueled to enhance the ship's performance and improve its resistance to EMP.

""I just like this kind of battlecruiser that fires straight forward, flying that kind of lateral beam ship always makes me mentally scratch my head."" -Unknown Councilor",,,
AL_frozenyard,SHIP,"Late in the ""Appro-Light Project"", this battlecarrier was designed to clean up the battlefield. ""None can stand before the Frozen Yard!"" Originem had given the Frozen Yard extremely high expectations in a meeting, but in fact, the current Frozen Yard is almost completely different from the original design. According to sources, the blueprint of the Frozen Yard was reconstructed. After a routine review process, the original blueprints were stolen by Luddic infiltrators lurking within the council. Although those thieves were eventually brought to justice, the blueprints were destroyed by accident during the capture operation, and it must be said that this incident was a stain on the Appro-Light Project.

After the end of the intense data recovery project, the new Frozen Yard was reborn in the ruins, although its practicality was still superior to many battle carriers. But whenever the birth of the Frozen Yard is mentioned, a look of gloom will appear on the faces of the technicians involved. Ouroboros, as one of those involved in the development of the Frozen Yard, who had the honor of learning the composition of the Legion-class blueprints, also had no small disagreement with the Speaker over this matter.

With four medium-sized missile racks on either side and a large missile rack in the center, the Frozen Yard and its fighters are able to jam enemy engines by carrying a special electronic warfare subsystem, which gives the Cold Yard the ability to intercept and destroy any warship. The price of strong missile firepower is a weak defense system, and the Frozen Yard uses a relatively outdated forward-fixed shield system to ensure the stability of its flux grid. Even so, with specific protection, this is not enough to be a fatal flaw for the Frozen Yard.",,,
AL_doctor,SHIP,"A battleship full of mysteries, it appeared after the end of the ""Appro-Light Project"" and the names of the participants in the design cannot be found in the general public. In the early days of the Doctorate-class battleship's design project, the press referred to it as a ""graduated Scholar"". It has excellent power data and durability, and is equipped with an extremely powerful primary core - the ultimate weapon, the ""Deity Cannon"", the ultimate technology that allows the fire control radar to operate at insane speeds when unblocked, and the ultimate weapon's firing restrictions. According to the propaganda, the Deity Cannon can offset the high resistance advantage of all shields, and cause damage without discrimination, which can overpower even the most shield-centric ships. It is worth noting that in public simulations, most captains felt that the Doctorate showed far less utility than expected and was far from the Appro-Light Scholar-class, while official designers argued that the Doctorate-class was designed as a low-speed artillery ship, more inclined to be used for fortifications than to follow the captain on his expeditions, while the A.L.S.S, like its sub-classes, was a high-speed assault warship suitable for quick battles, and naturally not comparable to the Doctorate.

However, unfortunately, after several months, the development of the Doctorate-class battleship was terminated in an official statement by the Appro-Light Council, the reason being that the  council's nanoforge was not able to manufacture a key component of the original core. After this, the Doctorate became a typical case of stardust buried on paper, living forever in the shadow of the Euclid and Frozen Yard classes. However, in the early days of the war between Appro-Light and the Knights Arbiter, someone once claimed in public that he had accidentally discovered a Doctorate that seemed to be on a classified mission while researching the technology behind the Burst Fog Generator. Although he was later arrested for stealing technology and provocation, could this mean that the Doctorate-class, which was proclaimed ""impossible"" officially, has been used secretly the whole time?",,,
AL_doctoralsupervisor,SHIP,"The Supervisor was born after the ""Appro-Light Project"" was over and the Ether Group successfully replicated the Paragon-class battleship. The cost of the entire hull is not high and maintenance is much easier than other line-breaker ships. However, by contrast, due to the extremely high structural coupling it is extremely difficult to customize.

The Supervisor uses two alloy tubes running the length of the entire body to stabilize the flux output. Compared with the fortress shield, the vessel can still fire freely when the shield is online but the firing rate is greatly limited in order to use the flux for the fortress shield. In addition the thermal capacity of the conductive material is very low which allows it to switch the tactical system quickly. Allowing it to switch quickly between the free-fire and the defensive posture with extremely high flexibility.

It is said that the chief designer of the Supervisor is the same one who designed the Doctorate; perhaps the choice of name is intended to express dissatisfaction towards the council's leaders.",,,
AL_repairfactory,SHIP,"The Academy-class Battle Fortress combines all these three aspect together - a fortress for the commander, a must-have for interstellar travel and top of the line technologies. It is a powerful firebase by itself and can resupply a large number of fighter wings. In the heat of battle, it can be called upon in the face of danger. When it reloads, all the captains are proud of it. Of course, it is the complete shipborne maintenance factory that is the essence of the Academy. The high-speed reconditioning between battles gives the Academy fleet the huge advantage of being able to sustain war with war. The enemy has given it a fearsome nickname - ""The Amethyst Leviathan"". However, it should be noted that the Academy itself is not suitable for the front, and its slow battlefield speed determines that it is only suitable for the whole fleet as an ""insurance"".

Compared with other giant warships, Academy-class are more inclined to logistics maintenance, stable and profound connotation.",,,
AL_granary,SHIP,"When the Appro-Light Council made preparations for exploration the Granary-class transport ship came into being. It quickly became a must-have choice for all commanders in the field. The combined cargo/fuel transport characteristics gave the ship a use with all council members. The soldiers expressed great appreciation. In order to reduce fuel consumption on long journeys the council used the spacious cargo hold to open up a number of special pipelines within gaps in the armor alongside a miniaturised anti-matter refinery. The refinery can be used to recover additional fuel from the battlefield so the fleet can operate at extended distances when a return to friendly territory isn't possible. In addition the refinery behaves as intelligent fuel saving tool adjusting fuel usage to optimal levels during travel.

Although the Granary dominated the top of captains' logistical ship lists for a long time, its position was eventually superseded by the Council's ally, the Borken Foundation's giant merchant ship, the Chagunar, due to the Granary's relatively poor cost effectiveness for both commercial activities in the core and utilization by stronger and more connected mercenaries.",,,
AL_granary_mk2,SHIP,"A heavily-armed refit of the Granary-class cargo ship, known among the council as the Granary Mk. II. It is entirely responsible for the supply and fleet stability of the exiles' outpost, carrying only a few combatants and pilots, the rest of the crew are supply logisticians.

While retaining most of the cargo and living space, the Granary Mk. II removes unnecessary fuel tanks and adds a large missile weapon interface at the commanding officer's discretion, reduced crew quarters and some ship space to add additional decks, reduced the power of the dimensional difference generator to reduce strain on the flux grid, adjusted the output level of the flare launchers to allow for autonomous interception, and completely militarized its subsystems.

The Granary Mk. II is a magnificent design that brings together all the whims of the Exile Outpost engineers and the vast combat experience of its commander, a terrifying armed cargo ship that would give all would-be looters a run for their money. Despite the extensive militarization, the interior still retains the recreational space and sufficient cargo space for the members of the Exile Outpost crew, all of which makes the ship's commander very happy. But apparently everything can't be perfect - due to extensive modifications, the Granary Mk. II is no longer suitable for Sector-wide exploration missions; though the exiles have no need for such a thing anyways.",,,
AL_boss_higgs,SHIP,"The Higgs-class battleship, a massive ship in hyperspace. It is an enhanced version of the Boson class, which is known as the ""universe's fundamental nature"". Long after the failure of the Appro-Light Project, and after Jormungand was deprived of power, Kukulkan turned against the scientists under him and violated the relevant parliamentary laws, using a large number of advanced AI cores as a living sacrifice to create an artificial intelligence closest to God with the most incredible mysterious technology - comparable to the operational speed of the then imprisoned Holy Seeker and Godship. This artificial intelligence was called ""Keel"".

Kukulkan took Keel to the ship warehouse and prepared to select a suitable ship as a carrier - Higgs. What Kukulkan did not expect was that the security he had placed on Keel was unlocked at this point. Keel broke away from the control and began operating the ship, but then directly opened a jump point, and disappeared; never again appearing in Kukulkan's sight.

Kukulkan thus received serious charges, but due to the disorder of the council's political system at the time, he escaped. The Higgs was later observed fighting with an Immortal-Light armada and winning a great victory, but there is no more information beyond that.",,,
AL_klistamanas,SHIP,"Some kind of intermediary product, or perhaps a stop-gap. The Essence-class capital ship was not designed by humans, but more likely a result of a Divine AI Core imitating the creation of the Higgs. The ship's commander has changed from an infected councilor to an infected AI core.

The Appro-Light Council's fleets first discovered it several years after the retreat of the Immortal-Light Front to the Chaos Rift, in the midst of a massive battle involving the Blade of Conviction. It appeared on the fleet's radar without warning, setting off a storm of EMP, and the original victory of Appro-Light's combined fleet was all-but instantly transformed into a defeat. The whole fleet tried to send a large number of light ships to destroy it from close range, only to find to their horror that the closer they got to the ship, the equipment or systems used to boost the power or other other improvements of their ships were inhibited; making one attack after another futile.

Although the battle was barely won with the intervention of Keel Higgs, the dark cloud of the Essence hung completely over the council: this class of ship gradually became a resident member of the Immortal-Light Front, making it exponentially more difficult for Appro-Light to defeat Immortal-Light fleets.

What is certain is that, unlike the Intelligence, Sentience, and other ships born from the Time Metamorphosis experiments, the creation of the Essence heralds the Divine's further intrusion into the realm of self-evolution; which will have consequences no one dares to think about.",,,
AL_master,SHIP,"""When darkness falls, guided by light, how will Appro-Light face this upside-down reality?"" - Jormungand

It was developed during the late stage of the ""Appro-Light Project"", and the secret confrontation between those who did not want to give up and those who were determined to compromise influenced the decision of the whole Spectre Nexus and the assassins began to emerge. In an attempt to quickly defeat the man who provoked the civil unrest, Truth Originem ordered all his loyalists to deliver results within a week, one of whom was an unknown designer from the Sindrian Diktat. As he scrambled to discuss the response he had the sudden epiphany to use the support of some council members to use the damaged blueprints of the Conquest-class to create the more powerful and infamous Master-class battlecruiser.

Under the control of the captain, the ship carried out a desperate decapitation operation that destroyed the entire team. Yes, somehow, it destroyed the entire enemy fleet by itself. The captain and crew went crazy after the operation. The Master became known as a perfect and deadly madness. After that the designer was sentenced to death and after several transfers of the ship the prototype Master was destroyed by the order of the President, after it was discovered that the bizarre circumstances that caused the ship's crew to go insane were impossible to remove; the Master that is now seen on the market is basically a degraded replica, retaining only a part of the core system of the ship: a powerful gravity generator.",,,

Although one of Laplace's prototype ships was required by contract to be delivered to another party, this did not prevent the designer from gaining the attention of the Council of Appro-Light afterwards and leveling up to great success.

The Laplace prototype ship did not have a uniform style. The research team at the time consisted of parts of the Ether Team and the Spirit Team, and once the main framework of the ship was determined, it was modified differently.",,,

This ship is no longer equipped with the built-in drones the Frozen Yard usually has. What is certain is that in the future, this drone launcher will have no effect. The Frozen Yard Prime has greatly improved its ability to resist damage, making it on the front line a not so silly strategy. The Frozen Yard Prime was first found in a unit escorted by the Immortal Light. It is worth noting that, during the council's total destruction of the force, they did not start destroying the Frozen Yard Prime, not knowing what they were afraid of. Another horrifying thing is that some of the Holy Seeker related machinery was discovered in the core flux section. After trying to start, when the atomic clock on the ship reached exactly 666 seconds, the ship had self-destructed, taking the lives of countless councillors and damaging the ship beyond repair.",,,

The AI on the ship meets all the expectations of all the captains in the council.

After several years of lengthy development, the Oppenheimer-class cruiser was born. This cruiser carried more advanced and dangerous tactical systems than the prototype.
