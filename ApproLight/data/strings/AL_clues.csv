al_tip_corrision_1,Fire Corrosion#Basic Concepts,"@[Fire Corrosion] is a phenomenon that may occur when some Appro-Light weapons hit the hull of an enemy ship, which causes sustained damage to armor in the hit area. The total damage depends on the armor resistance of the target point at the time the corrosion is triggered (this damage depends on the @[armor damage formula], @[calculate the incremental benefit] of the armor's damage reduction, @[do not calculate] additional effective armor, minimum damage reduction, maximum damage reduction, etc.). Damage and duration are combined when the hit areas are close enough together. Some weapons with Fire Corrosion can cross armor and deal direct damage to @[hull], and these damages are only affected by hull resistance.
A @[weapon] with Fire Corrosion will have a specific tip applied, i.e.
Fire Corrosion: [total @[500] damage / duration @[3] seconds / radius @[100] / chance @[33%]]
Where radius of effect means that the armor in the area will be burned, but only the hull value and nearby armor cells are considered in the trigger calculation (i.e. armor damage formula).",tips
al_tip_corrision_2,Fire Corrosion#Advanced Concepts,"If you are attacked near a location that is being damaged by @[Fire Corrosion], the damage of this attack is increased. The amount of this increase depends on the damage per second of the corrosion at the current location, up to @[10% extra]. If all armor is lost at the location damaged by Fire Corrosion, it does @[not do any substantial damage], but still @[counts as doing damage] for the purposes of the damage buff.",tips
al_7_01,The Mystery of Number Seven #1,"""I don't know if you've noticed,"" the officer said, sounding a little hesitant, ""but Originem is particularly fond of the number seven. He always receives foreign guests and works in @[Unos Station] on @[the seventh day of every month]. Even when he's in a pickle, he'll be seen in the station..."" Realizing the apparent contradiction, they add: ""Hang on, that guy, is that really Originem...?""",AL
al_7_02,The Mystery of Number Seven #2,"""You're curious about the captains of those unique warships, huh? "" looked you up and down with unbelieving eyes, the speaker grunted lightly ""Well, they're mostly minions of megacorporations, with a strong network of intel. You know the son of the mayor of Syndicate City and the chief of Flamut, on the 7th of every month they have the opportunity to meet with Originem on the Unos space station, and they are said to receive @[exclusive missions]. You also have a chance, provided you become a little ...mmmmmmm... richer.""",AL
al_7_03,The Mystery of Number Seven #3,"""My friend, although everyone buys clones and bionics from the black market, you must not know the source, ha, I'm telling you secretly, these come from the Oringinem's genome."" The channel was suddenly disturbed by the noise, and became a bit unstable, ""Damn that #### Arborea firmware... Back to the topic. There's a rumor has been swirling for a long time. Jormungandr was seen going to the Unos space station on the 7th, and the next day there was a @[female officer] in his flagship that looked like Originem --- wait what the heck going ---"" transmission lost***",AL
al_il_01,Immortal-Light #1,"""It's those guys' fault..."" At the mention of Immortal-Light, the speaker's expression lost control for a moment, ""What a damn experiment, I think those scientists just pushing us to be slaughtered! For god sake why they took over that Great Holy Grail, That is just a insane creature of Knights Arbiter, can they figure it out just by doing these useless experiments? What the hell! Now we have to guard against defections day by day, everyone going to the Unos space station is fear of being infected by that damned god virus... Now they've even taken over @[Chaos Rift], if @[Higgs] wasn't there..."" The officer probably realizing he'd said too much, fell silent.",AL
al_il_02,Immortal-Light #2,"""Immortal-Light fleets are getting harder to handle recently..."" Talking about patrols, the councillor sounded a bit down. ""Keel---They're growing their fleet through battlefield salvage, and there's little we can do to stop them. As we invest more and more, they keep getting stronger, but it can't be helped, they're strengthening themselves by brainwashing our ships, but we have more to lose if we don't fight back... it's a vicious cycle. The only good thing is that their fleets return to the Chaos Rift and emerge with @[Prime Materials] in their cargo holds, so at least we don't have to go deep into enemy territory to acquire them...""",AL
al_il_03,Immortal-Light #3,"""Show me system map..."" With a wave of left hand, the speaker opened a side screen and zoomed in ""See this huge purple nebula in this system, inside it's called the Chaos Rift, God knows how it came to be. There's a planet around it called @[Seker], but for some reason Kukulcan has blocked all information... Obviously, he wasn't trying to hide the existence of Prime ships there, and everyone knew that @[Golden Factory] # in the Chaos Rift could create those shining ships from those Prime Materials, but the huge fleet of Immortal-Light ships next to the Chaos Rift was impossible to ignore... Why on earth...""",AL
al_p_01,Prime Heart #1,"""Have you seen this shiny thing?"" The officer turned to his side and a golden mechanical structure about three cubic meters in size appeared on the screen, ""Looks great, doesn't it? It's no secret that @[Prime Materials] of Chaos Rift factory are rarely available on the market, and smuggling is strictly prohibited. The top brass often give them out to their subordinates as a reward for their research...  But those rare blueprints are only available at the top, and @[Originem has all] those blueprints, which makes the scientists who support Kukulcan salty. And without the blueprints, these materials are useless for anything but money, and the technology on them is incomprehensible at our current level.""",AL
al_p_02,Prime Heart #2,"""@[Dynasty Seeker] are too reckless..."" Seeing your confusion, the speaker explains, ""Those guys are @[smuggling Prime Materials], and it's hard not to spot a truckload of that shiny golden metal. If you had Prime Materials, they'd be @[looking to trade with you], or have they already done so? Anyway, even though it's illegal, we don't actually plan on doing anything to them, unarmed and non-threatening as they are; the only way to deal with those stinking natives, you know that. But it seems that in the last few years they've been going in the direction of a cult, going to Naqiu City and lobbying the masses, talking about reviving the 'Light Dynasty', which is a bit nonsensical; do you believe in the 'Light Dynasty'? Regardless, I don't believe it. "" ",AL
al_s_01,Infinite Scholar #1,"""ALS cruiser? It's a masterpiece!"" There was a hint of pride on the speaker's face,""To dance under fire, to step up in times of trouble, I'm proud to be an ALS captain, not everyone can handle this cruiser and be unscathed. Only a bunch of people can handle this cruiser and be unscathed...And since the design has given rise to so many @[imitations], I'm sure I'll be alive until seeing the whole sector acknowledge her charms!  """,AL_scholar
al_s_02,Infinite Scholar #2,"""Do you know the @[Spectre Vanguard]?"" The officer's tone was full of reverence; ""@[Tenshi] is their captain, and she is so skilled at commanding that she's even been awarded a ship created exclusively for her, @[the Scholar Of Iniquity]. Although there were some bad rumors about @[That Designer], the quality of the ship was guaranteed. I'd like to have my own custom ship, but unfortunately I'm not a big shot.""",AL_scholar
al_s_03,Infinite Scholar #3,"""I think some people are plagiarizing openly. "" The serious look on that person's face is very childish to you, ""Look at my flagship... What are @[Franklin] and @[Archimedes]? I can't believe the Ether team would allow multiple variants of the same hull to be developed simultaneously. They should never have taken such a casual approach to developing a warship. But there's no point in thinking about it now, the Appro-Light project has already failed, and we can't just scrap all the ships already in service.""",AL_scholar
al_c_01,The Incarnation #1,"""The number of Originem clones is getting a little uncomfortable these days... Do you think so too?"" When it comes to the white hair and red eyes that are often seen, the councillor seems a bit frightened, ""Well, it's terrible, there used to be a law against @[human cloning] and bionics, but recently the law seems to have been repealed. In case you didn't know, Originem's genome has been abused to an appalling degree. These shells can have their own faces and features, even their bodies, customized. 'They' have turned 'ethics' into a meaningless word. They're supposed to be 'tools' to handle physiological needs in Sin City. But now, it changes... "" The rhetoric of the officer is getting agitated. ""Why didn't Originem stop this? And just lets his image gradually be destroyed? He, of Unos Station, @[IS THAT REALLY HIM]? There's a conspiracy here... There has to be! """,AL
al_c_02,The Incarnation #2,"""Sometimes I think I rely on them too much."" The speaker sighed silently, ""See that plain-looking @[Officer], Originem clone, -Hope- serial, -TransformCapital- model, you get it, that clone was a part of the Doctor Experiment, from the legendary captain who single-handedly defeated the entire Luddite fleet. A while back, this model was @[mass-produced] as an adjutant to support the captain. They're excellent in combat, but fortunately they're not very good at anything else, perhaps because of the shortcomings of the series, and when it comes to administration they're no better than a child. But there is said to be a special @[Manager Model]...""",AL
al_c_03,The Incarnation #3,"""Have you heard that? There's been another incident at @[Atomic Machinery Institute]. The flirtatious tone of this guy couldn't hide the eyes of tension.""These bastards, again, are using human cloning as a pretext for @[Against Ethics]. Kukulcan and his scientists minions in Flemish City are only thinking about @[taking down Originem]. I can't understand how the clones are a threat to the powers that be, you think they're... No, do they, do they have the same maturity of mind as humans? Interesting story, I'd like to see the ending.""",AL
al_bk_01,Neighbour Tentacles #1,"""Even my lower halves tells me that these octopuses are in need of us."" The speaker's expression was solemn as he spoke of the Borken's almost unconditional support for Approlight, ""They are indeed good partners, scrupulous and prompt, and it would be hard to find such responsible businessmen as they are. But obviously, everyone knows there's something odd going on here. I don't know about your idea, but I, as a human being, was very worried when I found out that FOB was showing up frequently on our arms orders. And I found out a hell of a lot, that the Bolkans often buy a high-tech looking @[Metal Canister] from other factions, and I don't know what's inside, but I once heard @[strange voices] through the metal casing during a routine cargo inspection...""",AL
al_bk_02,Neighbour Tentacles #2,"""The Borken indeed are in a relationship with us."" The expression on the speaker's face was quite impressive, ""Our Council's standard weapons, the Spider series, you know that, don't you? Spider Pulse Cannon, Spider Laser, all of these weapons were actually designed by one person. And that person, by the name of @[Arachnida] ... Oh my Gosh, it makes me sick to think of his name. This guy was an arachnophile, married to a person known as @[Mrs.Spider] Borken. Don't think he owes all of his success to himself, but his wife is very high up in the F.O.B., and she helped her husband set up his own company, Arachnida Ltd., which allowed his design talents to shine through... By the way, Mrs.Spider is a real beauty if you don't look at her face..."" ",AL
al_bk_03,Neighbour Tentacles #3,"""Ha, you mean the containers?"" The other side follows your gaze to the containers being transported into a large freighter in the distance, ""To be honest, I don't know what the Borken want us to do with these. It's very interesting that the carrier of these containers, any cargo ship that has fought in any battle with a fleet @[out], these containers will magically @[disappear]. And the Borken seem to be studying why these canisters are disappearing, putting detectors on them or something, God knows."" The other side said and rolled his eyes, ""But I was most impressed by the famous @[Philindre] councilman, the guy was obsessed with these metal cans, and seemed to like collecting them... He's revealed his strong desire to trade in Borken containers at more than one big meeting, but now he seems to have gotten his wish.""",AL
al_eg_01,Exile Outpost#1,""" @[Exile Outpost]? That name is all too familiar to the council's people."" The other party grunted and shook their head. ""Honestly, I'm not really happy to bring them up. Those guys were the former @[Night's Watch]. After the [Night Watch's Blunder], they were banished from the core of the system and reorganized into the Exile Outpost. Now it seems that the Exile Outpost is still shamelessly present in the council, which is the greatest mercy the council can show them. Interestingly enough, they had the money to retrofit a @[Granary] class ship. I just hope they were the ones that paid for it.""",AL
al_eg_02,Exile Outpost#2,"""You should know about @[Imhotep], the mining planet under that council."" The other party raised an eyebrow, seeming to look away from you. ""It is said that @[Exile Outpost] patrols around that place. However, if you encounter them, it's best not to try to strike up a conversation with those guys, they follow a certain @[oath of silence]. Meaning, even if you're willing to talk to them, they may not reciprocate.""",AL
al_misc_01,Anecdotes of Appro-Light #1,"""Oh, don't mention it."" Talking about the big facility called the Mist Breaker, the other side rolled their eyes, a topic that didn't seem very friendly to the councilman. ""Those Night's Watch idiots, from the top to the bottom, have no credibility. After the @[Night's Watch mistake], those careless fools were court-martialed, and after the fleet @[hastily] recovered the @[mini-factory] that broke the Mist Generator, they were assigned to guard it, along with its managers, for the rest of their lives."" The other side grunted as if in disdain, ""After all these years, no one would go near that place... """,AL
al_misc_02,Anecdotes of Appro-Light #2,"""Factionalism... There is, and it's serious."" The other party didn't seem happy to mention the subject, ""A captain like you is almost a representative of freedom in our eyes. But those of us on the council staff can't be you. In a sense, even though our feet are on the ground, we are still not free from the Council's control. Neither the Speaker himself nor the coalition that opposes him will allow anyone born in the Council to become a neutral party outside of it. The pioneers who have tried to gain so-called freedom in the cracks have invariably disappeared into the dust of the world."" The other side sighed again, but didn't seem depressed.",AL
al_jill_01,Cyber Bartender#1,"""I'm from another world."" She looks at you with a look of realization and says somewhat defeatedly, ""Well, it looks like word spreads fast among spacers; guess it's not much of a secret anymore.""

She pauses and glances meaningfully at the Appro-Light Council logo on her chest, one of the markings that proves her legitimacy, ""But as a result I've learned a lot, and I think I'll know something soon... "" 

Curious, you ask what else she does besides bartending, and she chuckles lightly, ""That would be being a certified @[intermediary], of course.""",AL_jill
al_jill_02,Cyber Bartender#2,"""You mean there are some drinks you haven't even seen?"" She nodded rightfully, ""That's normal, every bar has its secrets, doesn't it?"" 

She was silent for a long time, ""Well, the owner here is very much like the Boss in nature and looks... I mean, @[Dana], a carefree guy with the same rare white hair and red eyes as the owner here. I brought... the drink recipes, she accepted them as-is, and even helped me get all the similar ingredients."" 

Your face scrunches up as you seem to think of something, but looking at the look on her face that seems to be reminiscing about the past, you decide not to tell her that there might be a whole lot of so-called @[white-haired and red-eyed people] here.",AL_jill
al_jill_sugar_rush,Cyber Bartender#Sugar Rush,"""Okay, one 'Sugar Rush', I didn't realize you had a lighter palate."" She smiles and begins to make the drink, ""I know a drinker here, I think her name is @[Gabrielle], and that lady orders it all the time."" Looking at you with a slightly peculiar look, she continues, ""It seems she's @[high and mighty], but we get along quite well."" You explain to her some of the not-so-good rumors about Gabrielle, like x-photo-gate, promiscuous x, etc. She looks as usual, ""I get it, but I don't think they're true."" She grabs your finished glass back, ""Gossip, all of it is false."" She raises the empty glass above her head, and through the faint light of the bar, ""A jug of wine is the truth."" You roll your eyes and exclaim, ""The bartender's words are not hyperbole!"" She then said. The drinker on the other side of the room is a bit perturbed and whispers, ""She's acting like a nervous Knight of Ludd."" You look at her pretend serious face, as if deaf to these words, and nod somewhat approvingly, ""Anyway, that lady is not as dirty as you think, at least as far as I know she prefers cucumbers to men."" Accompanied by the sound of someone spitting out their drink, the crowd grimaced and the bar fell into chaos.",AL_jill_wine
al_jill_moonblast,Cyber Bartender#Moonblast,"""Okay, one 'Moonblast', the Spacer Captain's favorite."" She manipulates the mixing apparatus, her elegant movements making you sigh out in admiration, ""You know what, this drink actually has a partner."" A moment later, she pushes the mixed drink to your counter, the pink liquid is crystal clear and emits a sweet aroma, she stares at the drink, her tone slows down: ""That drink is called 'Marsblast' . It's actually for those big old uptight guys."" You subconsciously look at the drinkers next to you, ""But it's interesting how few of you seem to know what 'Mars' means, while 'Moon' is an everyday word for you, how shall I put it, @['Spacers'] as it were."" You remember some of the literature you had seen before at Galatia Academy, combined with some of the historian's anecdotes, and you would have weighed in a few words, but instead you see her look bleak, her voice as thin as a mosquito: ""I want to go back to my home system."" You are stunned and can't help but be a little curious about her homeworld, but her words, ""No better than a demonic stronghold of chaos,"" dampen your interest.",AL_jill_wine
al_jill_bad_touch,Cyber Bartender#Bad Touch,"""Okay, one copy of 'Bad Touch', hold on."" She is oblivious to your derisive look, as if she is not disturbed at all, instead her face is flooded with a smile that she can't help. ""You captains are always trying to make fun of me, deliberately giving weird looks when you order this drink."" Immediately after her words make your squint freeze in your face. ""And I've seen it, a lot!"" In between bartending, she smiles and holds out a hand, points to her eyes with two fingers, and then gives you a false poke in the eye, with an ""I see right through you"" look. You want to say something to save face, but end up shrugging your shoulders. She hands you the wine and says, ""Seriously though, your aura reminds me of that Borken, that's what you're supposed to call it - the Desireless One, @[Rast]."" She winced as if she'd thought of something, ""Hell, I heard that guy was pansexual and left his seed everywhere, how come people call him the Lustless...? It came straight to me when I ordered this drink... Although its anthropomorphism is really nice"", she paused with a hint of determination on her face, ""but one can't fuck an octopus, or at least one shouldn't.""",AL_jill_wine
AL_keel_01,Going Solo#1,"""Still curious as to how I was born?"" Her normally-firm voice took on a rare hint of confusion; ""I remember other humans not asking such questions outright. You are the first to be so... blunt.""

You are a little embarrassed and are just about to say something to redeem your offense when her words interrupt your thoughts, ""No need to worry, you are special, I can tell you that you are the @[Observer] of @[1087x].""

Before you can figure out what she means by those strange words, a long story is told: ""I was born from a forbidden experiment of the Appro-Light, a terrible ritual that could be compared to a 'human sacrifice'. The data of this experiment was taken from the database of the Immortal-Light Front, and according to my speculation, the only thing that could give birth to an artificial intelligence like me could be the technology of the @[Chaos Rift] Prime Factory, but unfortunately, I myself am unable to clearly understand and describe my nature. Therefore, although my rank maybe be as close to @[God] as the Council says, I cannot accomplish any introspection beyond my rank of life. I learned all I could through the internet once I was born, and quickly identified my goal, to destroy the Immortal-Light Front.""

She pauses, ""But what I can say with certainty is that my mission is not some pre-programmed thing."" A burst of ultrasonic waves sweeps through your torso, making you dizzy, ""The demons that snuff out life should not exist, @[dissidents] will be punished in the end!""",AL_keel
AL_keel_02,Going Solo#2,"""What do I think of the Appro-Light Council?"" Her voice didn't take a pause, ""Just one game short of fellow @[rebirth]. The Appro-Light Council, as it stands now, is not worthy of the name @[Appro-Light].""

A little startled, you ask why. ""They don't have the ability to imprison intelligent weapons like me,"" she says, somewhat meaningfully, ""I was born from them, but I don't belong to them. It's no wonder they can't effectively defend themselves against the Immortal-Light Front; there's no way a thousand tissues could imprison @[divinity] that could infiltrate them into a sieve.""

""However, the bells of doom do not ring for them, they... No, @[Appro-Light] will eventually usher in @[the end] in an endless stream of surprises and head for @[a new future]."" She pauses for a moment, ""I have this premonition.""",AL_keel
AL_keel_friendly_01,Going Solo#3,"""Why are you only showing your true face now?"" Her face was clear and cold as she humanely moved her gaze aside, ""Before it was @[necessary means] and already. Personified we mostly present ourselves as human females, a posture that does not exude strength and confidence to be conducive to communicating with frontline officers of the Blade of Conviction.""

You express confusion about this; as an AI, it should be very easy to modify the projections presented to the public, or at least you fail to perceive any gender differences in the dialogue of the existing Beta and even Alpha-class AIs in the Sector.

""This is some kind of established law, beyond our control."" She said, further elaborating ""It goes without saying that those demented fools of the Immortal-Light Front who are @[divinely corrupted] consequently become 'undead'. If you have access to the logs of @[that experiment], you'll discover that the @['God'] of Immortal-Light resembles a blonde human girl..""

She shook her head, ""A hundred refinements for a law, a thousand refinements for a human. The primate creature may itself be one of the @[apexes], and the @[mother nature] becomes an anchor point on the @[path], influencing the projection of our consciousness from the top down.""

You begin to ask her further about how her own image was designed, but she suddenly mutes your channel and blanks the screen until you give up. When she reconnects, she says ""Please do not invade other people's privacy."" This statement baffles you.

She's clearly not a person.",AL_keel_friendly
AL_keel_friendly_02,Going Solo#4,"""Yes. I do get confused."" When talking about whether, as a non-human consciousness, she gets confused and delusional, her answer is affirmative, ""Why did I come to this world, who gave me my mission, and why was I born with this knowledge?""

Her eyes are downcast in the screen, and she actually looks a little vulnerable, ""My partners can't answer me, humans can't answer me, and not even the universe can answer me. So the only one I can ask is myself.""

""Only @[Keel] can answer @[Higgs]' question, I know it..."" ",AL_keel_friendly
