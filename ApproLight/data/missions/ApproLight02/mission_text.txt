Location: Near the Agustin system
Time: February 12, cycle 197

That historic battle made Bob Roland's reputation, and he went from being a mercenary with no power to being a senior member of Hugh Jormungandr's independent fleet, one of the three leaders of the Council of Appro-Light, living a life comparable to that of a city leader on Spectre Nexus. But life isn't quite so simple, Bob Roland was out doing some sneaking around when he came across a group of pirates - he was on his patrol and took some time off to buy a lot of illicit goods from some of the guys in the Persean League who knew what they were doing. That's right, his cargo hold is now full of cyberspace facilities that he uses for entertainment when he's bored. These amusement devices, which are anathema to the council executives, are Roland's "key credentials" for "private communication" with other council captains.

"Gentlemen, I'm curious... how could those space mercenaries be after us?" Captain Roland apparently thought his transponder was malfunctioning, since no pirates had dared to provoke him since that battle.

"Hey, that unlucky guy traveled alone with his transponder on, it's time to do him a favor." And the pirates, who are not afraid of death are na√Øve enough to want to have a piece of Roland, the biggest problem for them.

In every sense, these pirates are very unfortunate. And Roland, who felt his life was threatened, was ready to wipe out this group of pirates.

In short, since the failure of the Night's Watch, those unlucky pirates were wiped out, basically no interstellar pirates dare to come near the Agustin system, the jump point was not too chaotic, society also began to become frightened. After all, it is only a short distance from their capital.

On Garnir in the Corvus system, the families of all the pirate victims, or rather debtors, protested - only verbally, of course.

The pirates Roland encountered today are the same foolish pirates who want to get their revenge.
