This is our identity information, I don't know how much will be left after this battle. My sanity module tells me that even carrying the newly developed Echo Martyrdom Safety Device, there is no chance of leaving a black box at the end.

The Luddic Path fleet, in the second phase of our ship's primitive laser cannon experiments, suddenly appeared outside the jump point and used a wide-area EMP bomb to cut off our ship communicating with HQ, and was about to enter our range within an hour, with an estimated time of 3 hours for communications restoration, enough to win a battle with such a massive numbers disparity.

The size of their fleet could not be determined and they refused to communicate. It can be tentatively concluded that the purpose of their operation is to sink our ship and obtain information about our experiments. Our ship will fight back at all costs and to the last minute.

High energy ahead.
