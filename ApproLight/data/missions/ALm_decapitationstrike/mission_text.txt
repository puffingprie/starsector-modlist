Time: March 17, cycle 193

Every high profile person is protected all the time, in space by escort fleets and on land by marines. Equipped with sensors that are always up-to-date and portable shields that are always of the highest effectiveness. The same is true of the force currently in hiding, the Council of Appro-Light, and its leader. However, a hundred different things can always happen. In that almost instantaneous signal break, the Speaker and his female lieutenant, Gabriel, lost contact with the larger force, and his signal with his escort fleet suddenly disappeared from the home planet's information screen and caused an uproar.

This apparently contrived event laid bare the malicious intent of certain individuals towards the Appro-Light Council, as well as the almost unrivaled assassination skills of these individuals. The fleet floated silently in deep space, and beneath the surface silence was the panicked agitation inside the ship. Everyone was guessing who had planned the accident, and which organization the aggressive fleet of cruisers that had suddenly appeared in the sensors belonged to.

Jacky, a famous bounty hunter in the field of assassination, who has been wanted by the major powers for a long time, will join the hunt tonight. The target is the Speaker of the Council of Appro-Light.

The intelligent and aggressive female mercenary will add another glorious page to her innumerable battle records.
