The Knights Arbiter believe that the birth of the Council of Appro-Light means the downfall of the modern era. The Knights, who are committed to restoring peace, freedom and equality to the old universe, do not see this as a good thing.

As we all know, the old does not go, the new does not come, although the turmoil of the modern era has already made the saints of the Order anxious, but when they found the bastard child of two super organizations - the Appro-Light Council, the sense of crisis quickly occupied their heads.
But mindful of the confusing astro-political landscape, both sides wisely chose to remain silent.

"The monopoly of evil in the spirit is about to happen, and these villains will be punished!" After a minor conflict between Appro-Light and the Order's trade caravan, the nerves of a certain fleet leader of the Order ignited. 

Although the Council did not want to have much contact with this bunch of psychopaths who were shouting that the whole sector were infidels, the rapid and orderly fleet build-up of the other side immediately made the Council's alert index rise to a dangerous level.

All hatred aside, a ridiculous conflict was taking place that should not have happened.
