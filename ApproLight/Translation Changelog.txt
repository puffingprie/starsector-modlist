1.1.1:
	Ported over Appro 1.1.1
	
	Renamed Colorless Imagination to Monochrome Mantra
	(tried to) fix ultra beam description (thanks ansari)
	Removed duplicate portraits (making it save incompatible rip)
	
	My dumb ass failed to port over the person_missions.csv for 1.1.0, so now it's there and hopefully works
	Related to the above: changed references to "Confidant" to "Seeker" (as it's meant to be the Dynasty Seeker)
	
	Corrects the following untranslated things:
		Subtext for keel helping you repair the isomery
		Corrosion Piercer Armament's category

	Fixes several other minor things

1.0.6-B5:

Major:
-Starting keeping a changelog file.
-Fixed the inaccurate descriptions of the following things:
	Tablet, Euclid, Pupil, Divine Knowledge, White Wolf, Euclid (M) ship systems
	Deity Cannon, Purging Fire Pulse Cannon, PF - Respector Star-Cannon, and Respector Tri-Beam onhit effects
-The Fire Corrosion clues are hopefully less confusing now (Thanks to TheDragn)
-Julianne's role is now actually added

Minor:

-Made some relatively minor fixes to almost everything (whether due to errors or the translation needing updating to match the modern version). Planets, ship systems, weapons, etc.
-Knowledge and Divine Knowledge are now "Divine Destroyer/Divine Cruiser" rather than "Core Ship/Expedition Cruiser"
-References to Burst Fog and Breaking Mist are now consistent in favor of the latter
