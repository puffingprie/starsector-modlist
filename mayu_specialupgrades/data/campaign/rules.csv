The bartender sighs, refills the customer's drink, and, with a tired smile, motions for you to take a seat. Flustered, you sit down at the bar and order a drink while you subtly observe the angry man.

""32. That's all it had to hit. Fucking. 32. All my money, lost on a stupid bet... Where the hell am I going to get the money to get out of this place anyway? Shit...""

He picks up his refilled glass, grimaces, and takes a long gulp. He looks to his side and seems to take notice of you. His right hand reflexively moves down to the metal case on the stool next to him, and a hungry look appears in his eyes. You hear him whisper something under his breath, but you can't quite make it out. 

""Hey, you!"" He elbows you as you put your drink to your lips, almost causing you to spill. ""Moment of your time? I happen to have picked up something pretty interesting a little while ago. Might be of use to a spacer like yourself.""","introPTGamblerCont:""Explain.""",

I hit the jackpot on the slots and got, well, maybe a little overconfident. I figured I'd take those winnings to the roulette table and see just how far I could push my luck.""

He suddenly frowns and kneads his brows. ""Gambler's fallacy, right? I'm a university professor! I should've known better.
