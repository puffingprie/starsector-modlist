Electromagnetic Mastery,al_hfmounts,,,Exodus Initiative,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.al_hfweaponmounts,"Though rather crudely constructed, the design of this vessel displays an almost unparalleled understanding of electromagnetism. 

Suspended weapon mounts increase weapon range by %s and reduce weapon recoil and spread by %s

Ionic thrusters can more effectively utilize excess flux dissipation compared to most other forms of propulsion, yielding a %s/%s/%s/%s bonus to zero-flux speed boost, scaling up with hullsize.
