Location: Somewhere in the fringe depths of the Arcadian nebula.
Date: 201.12.22

You've been stalking through these clouds of charged dust for almost a month now, but at last one of your scout frigates has reported that the listening post has been found. A mere spy station on the edge of this dusty system hardly seems worth your time, but your superiors are paying well for this bounty so you can only assume someone somewhere wants it gone, and bad.

You approach the nebula it's hiding in, your scout frigate rejoins the formation and relays that it detected a series of engine plumes in some other clouds of dust on the oposite side of the target, a defending garrison perhaps? or maybe pirates stalking the nebula for loot, only one way to find out.

One way or another you were hoping for a fight.
