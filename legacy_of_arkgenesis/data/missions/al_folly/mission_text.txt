Location: An unknown fringe system on the edge of Domain space.
Date: Unknown

The host we have been tracking has started emitting anomalous hyperband waves, I believe it to be some sort of message, patching it through now.

--Hear me, fair citizens of the Domain, I am admiral William Alastair, and today I speak to you on behalf of our great and powerful nation. Your cries for salvation have not gone un-heard. High Command has recieved word of this unprovoked incursion of our soverign territory, and has decided that no man, woman, or child should have to fear for life on the very soil they call home, no matter how remote that soil may be to our core worlds. 

I am pleased to announce that you need to fear no longer, for in a mere few hours, my fleet will make contact with these barbarous invaders and wipe them from existence in short order. Our reports indicate that their numbers are few, and their ships are ragged and frail, so if you have spent the past few days making peace with your loved ones, you may instead celebrate! or return to your daily lives. The next message you hear from us, will be a declaration of victory, all ships, ONWARD!--

If I understood that correctly... I believe their intentions to be hostile, should we send the freighters back?
