'You're late to the party major, I would have expected better from the 'Ghost of Jangalla' hah. No matter though, the Hegemony patrol is broken and scattered, they never expected we'd be hiding our signatures in a debris field of all things. I doubt they even had time to set down their coffee!'

'Anyway. a good number of them managed to escape, and those withering Mayasuran exiles are paying us by the head. If you want to make yourself useful, my fleet is still regrouping after the battle, if you start your deceleration burn a little late, you'll probably catch up with the rest of the Hegemony before they've had time to finish repairs.'

'Godspeed Major, and record this for me if it wouldn't be too much trouble.'
