#====================================== FIGHTERS ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,
al_monodrone,SHIP,"A cheap, unmanned combat drone consisting of little more than an engine and a weapon bolted to a gyroscope. Due to the lack of any real maintenance profile or crew requirement, they are bar none the most cost-effective fighter-based fire support option to be found anywhere. Unfortunately they perform about as well as one would expect, struggling to do any real damage to warships and being nigh incapable of engaging other fighters in direct combat.",,,

loa_baron,SHIP,"A carrier-operated gunboat best deployed to counter a fighter-heavy environment. Though slow, thick armor keeps its considerable crew compliment alive, while an omnidirectional array of laser weapons make the going tough for incomming missiles and enemy strike craft. The Baron can also harass warships with kinetic missiles and its own hulking frame, but a lack of sustained damage makes it struggle against anything larger than a frigate. Additionally, this wing is capable of supporting ground operations in a gunship role.",,,

loa_jack,SHIP,"A heavy combat drone posessing a wide but unimpressive engagement profile. Capable of posing some sort of threat to just about any targer, the Jack is mostly held back by a flimsy frame exposed by a lack of shields. However, captains and crews alike pay little mind to the grevious casualties Jacks tend to suffer, since they are entirely un-manned and easy to replace.",,,

loa_bidrone,SHIP,"A reasonably sturdy, appreciably dangerous, and amazingly cheap heavy combat drone. Achieving this desirable blend of traits seems to have required too many design elements specific to the context of a Hawke class drone carrier for it to be practically translated into a general-use fighter wing.",,,

al_emdrone,SHIP,"Little more than an armored tesla coil built around a tidal generator. The creatively named EMP Disc"" is less of a drone than an esoteric weapon in and of itself. Directed by specialized magnetic levitation turrets housed within a host vessel", its control scheme doubles as its powersource, the magnetic pull on the internal generator powering the coils," which lash out at nearby targets once saturation is achieved."""

al_ace,SHIP,"A well-rounded dogfighter from head to toe, the Ace combines sturdy hull plating with respectable maneuverability and reliable damage application. This results in a fairly wide engagement profile with extra emphasis on engaging other strike craft. Additionally, this wing is capable of supporting ground operations in an air superiority role.",,,

al_earl,SHIP,"Loosely classified as a strike fighter, the Earl operates more akin to a proper bomber, the whole ship being dedicated to delivering a single devastating payload of superheated plasma. A reinforced hull and independently powered shield generator help it survive its harrowing journey.",,,

al_duke,SHIP,"One of the largest ships ever launched from a flight deck, the Duke is more of a miniature warship than a strike craft. Built around a massive underslung turret and posessing a ship-grade targeting suite, this gunboat excels at harassing large targets, but remains fairly vulnerable against fighters. Additionally, this wing is capable of supporting ground operations in a gunship and troop transport role.",,,

#====================================== FRIGATES ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,
loalt_oogik_r,SHIP,"An unusual frigate refurbished from derelict status after untold centuries of lifelessness. Completely unremarkable in ability, its far more interesting as a topic of study, running novel, low technology systems while mounting high-technology weapons.",,,

loalt_oogik_d,SHIP,"A tiny speck in an endless void, this broken hulk has clearly been left adrift for a thousand years, give or take a few centuries. Beneath the surface are obvious signs of a proper scuttling, everything that wasn't nailed down has been long removed, and nothing that's left is familiar to any of your engineers. A cursory analysis suggests that this ship's tactical capabilities are unlikely to justify its considerable restoration costs.",,,

loalt_taath_r,SHIP,"An unusual frigate refurbished from derelict status after untold centuries of lifelessness. The total novelty of its construction asside, this enigma packs a heavy primary armament curiously mounted in reverse, and fed by a primitive power core that would struggle to run most of the guns it could concievably mount.",,,

loalt_taath_d,SHIP,"A tiny speck in an endless void, this broken hulk has clearly been left adrift for a thousand years, give or take a few centuries.

A cursory analysis suggests that this ship's tactical capabilities are unlikely to justify its considerable restoration costs.",,,

loa_ike,SHIP,"A frigate sized assault shuttle with powerful secondary thrusters capable of brute forcing the craft through any gravity well. It is capable of putting it's relatively modest warship-grade arsenal into service against ground-based targets, in addition to an extensive suite of anti-surface countermeasures. 

It wouldn't be entirely hyperbole to state that the Society owes its existence to the Ike, leveraging its capabilities to embark on numerous raids, pilfering supplies and loot to fund and facilitate their operations in seeming perpetuity.

Perhaps most interesting however, is the spaceframe itself. Lacking many of the technological signatures typically employed by the ARS, the Ike has more in common with their export hulls than anything else they field as part of standard operations, despite being wholy absent from the former catalogue.",,,

loamt_fox,SHIP,"A small, lightly armed warship mostly deployed for scouting or commerce raiding missions. The Fox is fragile, but exceptionally quick, relying on its agility to survive engagements while harrassing targets or running down non-combat ships.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtg_fox,SHIP,"One of the cheapest military grade vessels to be found anywhere, while still retaining most of its progenitor's agility. These traits mix nicely to make export Foxes the single most common Society-derived hull to be seen outside of the Society itself.

While not considered an industrial powerhouse, the Anarakis Reparations Society produces a steady supply of new ship hulls exclusively for export. Combining shipbreaking efforts with their own designs, these hulls are a patchwork amalgamation of parts that are far more reliable than their outward appearance would lead you to believe. As a result, they can frequently be found in the armadas of minor powers and pirate warlords the sector over.",,,

loamtp_fox,SHIP,"A coffin for the insane, this export Fox has found its way into the hands of pirates, who have jury rigged its engines to hell and back in an ill-concieved quest to become one of the fastest moving objects on the battlefield, at any cost.

loamt_edith,SHIP,"A support frigate carrying only token weaponry, the Edith instead carries an immense array of ultra-high-gain sensors and vector calculation software.  When positioned properly in the line of battle, it can extend the range of an entire squadron of warships well past typical limits, a distinct advantage that can turn the tide of any engagement.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_sherman,SHIP,"A slow, bulky frigate lacking in ordinance for its size. The Sherman shines when used as an anchor for more mobile ships, standing in enemy fire and making up for its light arsenal by being incredibly hard to put down.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_walsh,SHIP,"An agile attack frigate often seen escorting larger Society warships. Constructed around a hull-spanning network of ordinance management hardware, the Walsh can hurl considerable ammounts of gunfire downrange, as long as it holds together.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtg_walsh,SHIP,"An export variant of the Walsh typically employed by minor factions for use as a patrol interceptor to counter light smuggling or combat piracy as part of a larger flotilla. Low crew requirement and an easy maintenence profile mix well with high mobility and respectable firepower for this role. The resulting level of demand by legitimate parties makes this frigate impractical for pirates to acquire.

loamt_reid,SHIP,"Large, imposing, and armed to the teeth, upon arriving in the Persean Sector, the Reid was mistakenly classed as a light destroyer. While a lack of heavy mounts prevents it from effectively throwing down with actual destroyers, its vast array of small, focused gun emplacements and impressive tactical speed make it incredibly deadly to other frigates.

#====================================== DESTROYERS ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,

loalt_nicke_r,SHIP,"An unusual destroyer refurbished from derelict status after countless centuries of lifelessness. It sports a potent battery of modular energy weapons supported by an integrated heavy railgun capable of firing two distinct types of munitions. The only other specific point of note is how crude many of its systems are compared to its intended weapon selection.",,,

loalt_nicke_d,SHIP,"A diminutive speck in an endless void, this broken hulk has clearly been left adrift for a thousand years, give or take a few centuries. Beneath the surface are obvious signs of a proper scuttling, everything that wasn't nailed down has been long removed, and nothing that's left is familiar to any of your engineers. A cursory analysis suggests that this ship's tactical capabilities are unlikely to justify its considerable restoration costs.",,,

loamt_victoria,SHIP,"A sight almost synonymous with the Reparations Society itself, the Victoria combines high maneuverability, respectable firepower, and dependable support functionality into a sturdy, flexible hull. Those who find themselves facing one in battle are advised to keep their shields up, lest ""the curse of victory's witch"" consign them to the void. 

This ammusing story, often told by veterans heavy on drink, stems from the inclusion of a unique integrated structural analysis suite. A standard, if bulky computing rack capable of near-gamma level calculations, programmed specifically to analyze sensor data and provide unfathamobly detailed real-time structural information on the ship's target. When transmited to an entire fleet, it allows gunnery crews to crack open even the sturdiest hulls like an egg.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_osmond,SHIP,"Packing an odd layout of heavy firepower and propelled by a robust engine assembly, the pointed frame of the Osmond Heavy Destroyer is an uncommon sight commanding common respect. It is constructed around the same network of electromagnets the Alistair class battlecruiser is famous for, giving it the ability to cripple targets from a distance. However, numerous sophisticated components shared between the two ships force them to compete with one another at the drydock, making the Osmond difficult to field reliably.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_norwood,SHIP,"Combining the fuel capacity of a small tanker with a considerable stockpile of guided ordinance, the Norwood serves as an ample platform from which to hurl missiles at the enemy. Despite superstition, this combat tanker is not the powderkeg that rumors would have you believe, but a severe lack of direct fire weaponry makes it ill-suited for direct confrontation none the less.

In a similar vein to the Jameson's cargo clamps, the antimatter tanks of the Norwood appear to be some sort of proprietary system unknown elsewhere in the Sector. While measures have been taken to mitigate this, it still makes restocking the ship somewhat onerous at certain drydocks.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_thatcher,SHIP,"A robust and agile light destroyer which forms the backbone for many of the Society's smaller raiding parties. Similar to the Walsh and King classes, its anemic armament is reinforced by an integrated Omni-Loader system. Despite this, the Taylor in particular suffers from a lack of available hardpoints, making weapon choice incredibly important.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtg_thatcher,SHIP,"An Export variant of the Taylor class light destroyer commonly deployed for patrol and enforcement duty with minor powers, and sometimes the Persean League. Removal of the bulky Omni-Loader has allowed this retrofit to keep its flexible primary mounts, and the installation of secondary thrusters has made it exceptionally fast for a ship of its class, if somewhat under-gunned.

loamtp_thatcher,SHIP,"An export Taylor which has been obtained, legally or otherwise, by pirates, who uncharacteristically, turned it into a small, makeshift escort carrier at the cost of most of its cargo space.

loamt_burke,SHIP,"Constructed primarily around a strange piece of targeting equipment, the Burke is surprisingly dangerous yet best kept within arms reach of a nimble escort. Its single oversized weapon mount allows it to fling heavy fire at great distance for a ship of its size, but technical limitations in its esoteric sensor suite as well as a poor secondary weapons package leave the lumbering destroyer fairly vulnerable if left unguarded.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtp_burke,SHIP,"An ungaingly variant of the Burke class destroyer sacrificing nearly everything for two large hardpoints. Fairly uncommon, nobody is entirely sure if these ships are the result of a custom order placed with the Society itself, or a home-grown retrofit performed directly by some insane warlord. What people are sure of however, are the unhinged personalities of those who choose to fly them.

loamt_caswell,SHIP,"Unique within the Society as one of the only ships dedicated wholey to the deployment of strike craft, the Caswell none the less fills the role with flying colors. Respectable mobility at both the strategic and tactical levels allow it to harry foes from a distance with wings of strike craft while numerous overlapping turret arcs keep it safe from the same.

Though surprisingly standardized from the outside, Pilots who have flown for the Society attest that on the inside, no two Caswell hangars are the same. Each ship posesses a unique mashup of stolen industrial equipment from widely varied sources, ranging from the jury-rigged nanoforges of other carriers, to the industrial vats of surface based complexes. While this serves as evidence of the Society's limited access to autoforge technology, the ship's effectiveness regardless serves as a solid testament to their ingenuity.

#====================================== CRUISERS ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,

loalt_eylamn_r,SHIP,"An unusual cruiser refurbished from derelict status after untold centuries of lifelessness. This ship defies all commonly known historical Domain doctrines, with an eclectic combination of heavy armor, an oversized powerplant, and weapon mounts mostly designed to accomodate directed energy weapons. It's secondary thruster system is capable of propelling this hefty mass at startling speeds, but reliability is a concern during protracted engagements.",,,

loalt_eylamn_d,SHIP,"An insignifigant speck in an endless void, this broken hulk has clearly been left adrift for a thousand years, give or take a few centuries. Beneath the surface are obvious signs of a proper scuttling, everything that wasn't nailed down has been long removed, and nothing that's left is familiar to any of your engineers. A cursory analysis suggests that this ship's tactical capabilities are unlikely to justify its considerable restoration costs.",,,

loamt_hawke,SHIP,"The Hawke is a light cruiser specially constructed for the deployment of un-manned strike craft. While fast, it is lacking in direct firepower, even compared to other ships of similar tonnage. This is compensated for by a host of heavy drones, well regarded as far more effective than their price tag gives them any right to be.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtg_hawke,SHIP,"An export variant of the Hawke class drone carrier. Either unwilling or unable to provide logistical support for the Hawke's drones to third parties, its efficient but highly specialized manufacturies have been replaced with industrial forge-vats jury rigged to serve as fighter nanoforges. While this technically opens up a wider array of tactical possibilities, the bootleg nanoforges spill out onto the flight decks themselves, making it difficult to service more complicated types of strike craft.

loamtp_hawke,SHIP,"Originally an export Hawke, pirates have completely rearranged it into a heavy gunboat, with guns poking out at every concievable angle. Lowered displacement and additional maneuvering thrusters have even left it faster than its progenitor.

loamt_king,SHIP,"A cramped hull constructed around the largest example of the Reparations Society's infamous Omni Loader, the King sacrifices endurance for raw firepower. With a bevy of weapons at all sizes, and its head crowned by a single heavy mount, the King hits hard and runs hot. On the flip side, thin armor and anemic power systems makes head to head brawls a dubious prospect.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_lyons,SHIP,"Meandering forward from behind monolithic layers of polarized ferroceremic, the Lyons strengths lie in presence and pressure. Sturdy defenses protect its modest and varied armament from reprisal as it steadily advances, driving a wedge into hostile lines for more aggressive ships to exploit.

As the Society considers the operation of autoforge technology to be a luxury, the nanoforges servicing its flight decks are usually stolen, directly or otherwise from various other existing classes of carrier, then haphazardly spliced into place wherever they will fit. While this jury rig is thorough, and undoubtedly effective, representatives from the Society have been willing to admit in the past that they have no idea what the original hardware is supposed to consist of.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamt_macnamara,SHIP,"An imposting behemoth of a cruiser bristling with focused gun emplacements and posessed of the speed to apply them, The Macnamara is a predator from bow to stern. Despite its reputation, a massive aftward blind spot leaves it notably vulnerable to flanking maneuvers and fleets of smaller craft. As a result it is rarely seen un-escorted by smaller craft, particularly its sister ship, the Reid.

It is widely assumed that this ship is used as a crutch to prop up the Society's limited number of Alastair class battlecruisers, given that it is often seen leading fleets far larger than most would consider flagging with a mere cruiser.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

loamtp_bigmac,SHIP,"A deranged vessel for a deranged soul, what heritage this Macnamara may have once had has since been cast into the abyss in service of a crazed lunatic's revenge quest against humanity itself for slights even Ludd cannot fathom. While its captain's ability to maintain a protracted war against the entire sector remains in question, the ship itself is not to be trifled with. A veritable Jambalaya of components spanning the entire breadth of Domain and possibly extra-Domain history, the self-styled 'Big-Mac' is a monstrous cruiser capable of outright devouring almost anything it sets its astropaint eyes on.",,,

,,,,,
loamt_jameson,SHIP,"Most often utilized as a treasure ship by the Reparations Society, the Jameson boasts respectable holds and sufficient fighter projection to serve as a competent fleet support vessel and cargo hauler.

Jameson holds are typically made from permanently welding the chopped up holds of other freighters to its frame, but design aspects suggest it was originally meant to be used with detatchable, modular containers. Curiously, the implied clamping dimensions do not match any known shipping unit registered with Domain or Hegemony commerce regulations.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

,,,,,
loaht_champion1,SHIP,"Found drifting and lifeless in the cold void of space, the Lancer is something of an enigma to engineers and historians alike. Sporting an obscene number of small guns which can be efficiently brought to bear by a network of purportedly reactionless engines, this mysterious cruiser excels at getting into and out of brawls. This is helped by a thick, contoured armor belt, a thin but remarkably strong shield, and a somewhat baffling ability to phase in short bursts. This odd menagerie of traits compliment each other with frightening efficacy and make the Lancer a uniquely fearsome opponent.

Though only one is known to exist within the confines of the sector, those who find themselves engaging it in combat are advised to practice caution.",,,
,,,,,
#====================================== FACTIONS ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,
al_ars,FACTION,"Tenatively tracing their lineage back to a series of mostly forgotten anti-war protests during the earliest days of Domain history, how the Anarakis Reparations Society came to be the duplicitous band of privateers they are today is anyone's guess. They claim alliegence to an unknown entity referred to as 'Arkgneisis' and rely mostly on antiquated pre-autoforge industrial techniques that, while limiting to their capacity for war, serve as the perfect economic insulator for these trying times. History tells that they showed up on the Persean stage roughly 50 years after the collapse, and spent a few subsequent decades mostly minding their own business outside of the odd raiding party.

Declared to be terrorists by the Hegemony even before the raids started, most others in the sector saw them as little more than a minor, if better organized band of pirates. It wouldnt be until shortly after the fall of Mayasura that the wider sector would appreciate the label. During this time the Society launched a short but devistating assymetric war against the Hegemony backed by financial resources from a few vengeful holdouts. This offensive would ultimately come too late to drastically change the outcome of the first AI war, and though the Society did not sign the treaty, their attacks would dwindle alongside the coffers of their benefactors.

Nowadays almost every notable faction in the sector will avail themselves of the Society's primary export at one point or another. For its leadership, turning on yesterdays clients and accepting payment from todays targets are simply a matter of course, revealing no discernable political stake in anything they do. As a result, the complete lack of trust they foster is matched only by their undeniable utility to those around them, with a rare exception remaining in the Hegemony, whom they claim to detest as a matter of principle...

...What that principle is however? Is 'also' anyone's guess.",,,

,,,,,
loa_arsstation_core3,SHIP,"An extensive installation built into the substrate of a natural asteroid, these sorts of stations tend to be cheap and fairly low tech, but rugged and durable. This example has been heavily built up, with multiple districts erupting from the surface of the asteroid, as well as having annexed additional rocks. One should expect such facilities to be roughly comparable to any other star fortress in terms of firepower, and as such they should not be assaulted casually.",,,

loa_random_market_tier4,CUSTOM,"Sitting large amist the field of rocks, barely even hidden anymore, this base is an ungaingly mess of rock and steel. Larger than is typical, this station has been recently expanded, serving as the new ARS headquarters after the destruction of Anargaia.",,"This station has a surprisingly modern harbor district embedded in one of its rockfaces. Ships of all sizes can be seen floating to and from the walls, while others are being refit, broken down, or built. Stepping off the dock you are directed by port workers toward a customs office, and quickly cleared for entry into the wider facility. The distinct atmosphere of chaos permeates the entire station, facilities being crammed wherever there is room, Reparators scrambling to and from all directions as they try to make this base suit a function it was never intended to serve.",


loa_anargaia,CUSTOM,"Elusive to the point of myth, and the central pillar to the Society's web of logistics and command, Anargaia is a ship unlike any in the sector. Utterly gargantuan, and horrifically well armed, it wanders between stars on the back of an antiquated method of FTL, spreading chaos wherever it goes.",,"Your shuttle is directed into an immense canyon running down the front of the ship. You can see ships, both visitor's and the Society's own being built, serviced, and torn apart in the many bays that line its walls. After several stages of processing you are finally dropped off on the 'visitor's concourse' A huge rotating drum internalized within Anargaia's hull. Asside from the unverving movement of the cieling crawling by overhead, it's much the same as any other major port, with all the ammenities and bustle you've come to expect from this lifestyle.",

,,,,,

,,,,,

loa_arscapitol_core,SHIP,"The sheer dimensions of this vessel lend themselves to obscuring its existence in legend, a trait the Society is all too willing to embrace. None the less, Anargaia exists, and serves as the de-facto 'capitol' of the Anarakis Reparations Society. It is a mobile fortress in every sense of the word, coordinating, supplying, and defending Society operations wherever it sails. In addition to its hobsean logistical capacity, the vessel is an exceptionally lethal warship in it's own right. While the Society is largely unwilling to gamble such an irreplacable asset in a direct assault on their enemies, any who wish to enact the reverse will find themselves staring down strategic levels of firepower with very few windows of retreat should they change their minds, and that's before considering any accompanying fleets.

How the Society built Anargaia is a complete mystery, given the sheer logistical scale it theoretically takes to construct such a leviathan. Structurally it is an amalgamation of novel engineering and scavenged hulls, some dating back almost 1000 years. Additionally, the hull bears the patchworked evidence of having been refurbished several hundred times, leading most to conclude that however much its operation might cost the Society, it's ability to project force across the cosmos must be worth it."

#====================================== CAPITALS ======================================,,,,,
,,,,,
loamt_alastair,SHIP,"An uncommon sight representing the absolute limit of the Reparation Society's antiquated industrial techniques. The Alastair barely achieves the tonnage to be called a capital ship, but is surprisingly resiliant and appreciably fast within the classification. Additionally, the frame of this vessel has been built around a unique device capable of crippling targets from great distance. Where the uninitiated see a small, unimpressive battlecruiser, the experienced see a lethal heavy interdictor.

Scraps of historical data dredged up from tech mining expeditions attribute the name of this class to a Rear Admiral in the Domain navy who lived some time during the Early Epoch. Under what circumstances this came about is a popular topic of debate among historians the sector over.

While not much to look at, this ship is a forest of jury rigs and redundancy that make it extremely accomodating to having its internals rearranged.",,,

,,,,,
loamt_gaillard,SHIP,"Referred to by the Society as 'Battleship One', Hegemony intelligence scrambled to identify the Gaillard shortly after its battlefield debut, and have come to the chilling conclusion that they have no idea where it came from. Adequate defenses, powerful engines for her size, and absolutely bristling with turret mounts, the Gaillard is nothing if not a well-rounded, capital-scale bullet hose.

While opening up many questions, at least one has been answered, a Gaillard is, essentially, an extended Donovan, which makes up the aft portion of their considerable bulk, and explains the latter's strange prow trough. Having previously suspected it to be a mounting point for some sort of super weapon, the sector's main powers are still largely unsure if the truth is any better.",,,

,,,,,
loamt_donovan,SHIP,"Strategists the sector over have debated since the Society's arriaval whether or not the Donovan even classifies as a capital ship. What isn't debated however, is their status as priority targets in the order of battle. On the surface they seem wholly underwhelming for their size, posessing destroyer grade armaments and a passable missile complement. Its secret is the missile assembly lines lurking just under its surface, enabling the Donovan to deploy a steady stream of high-yield ordinance ad infinitum.

While military minds spend their time wondering how to classify the Donovan, engineers have their own mystery to ponder. As far as anyone can tell, the massive front plow built into the ship serves no purpose, being little more than a collection of struts and sockets. Absent of any related intel from the Society itself, speculation has posited that it might be a massive weapon mount, implying that the design itself is incomplete.",,,
