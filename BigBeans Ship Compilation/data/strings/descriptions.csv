BSC_Brigantine,SHIP,"An extremely well put together Light Cruiser by pirate standards. Unlike most pirate craft this appears to be an original vessel rather than a modification, implying that some lucky pirate found its blueprint and then put it into production. Despite being as large as a cruiser this ship has specifications more befitting a destroyer, leaving it in an awkward position where its size does not match its capabilities. Despite that, it is still an absolute terror for traders and small patrol ships to face.",,,
BSC_Buffalo_Mk3,SHIP,"A light carrier designed by desperate Independent traders in order to have some form of fighter escort for their convoys. While not exactly militarised or armed or even armoured, their ease of conversion has resulted in these carriers being used by most factions across the sector.",,,
BSC_Brave,SHIP,"Designed as an economical all-rounder frigate for use by Domain fleets and patrols, the Brave is a dependable if unremarkable ship with decent firepower and maneuverability but most importantly a cheap price and operating cost. Favoured by the Persean League and occasionally used by the Hegemony, both of whom use it as a cheap escort for their more important ships.",,,
BSC_Aghast,SHIP,"This slim light cruiser is a dedicated interdictor vessel equipped with a phase ship interdiction array mounted in a generator on its left side. The array completely overloads phase ships for a few seconds, allowing the cruiser or its allies to deal with the threat. The array can only target phase ships however and against regular vessels the Aghast is very much lacking in firepower for its size and cost.",,,
BSC_Tramp,SHIP,"Little more than a cargo container with an engine and bridge, the Tramp is the premium freighter for the destitute and extremely frugal. While it has some armament, the Tramp is best served burning away from a fight, not towards one.",,,
BSC_Marauder,SHIP,"A light destroyer whos professional construction implies that another new blueprint has fallen into Pirate hands. Fast and suprisingly well armed, this ship will struggle against larger destroyers but is perfect for raiding trade ships.",,,
BSC_Mudskipper_MK3,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have copied Pirate modifications to the Mudskipper and have made further alterations to make it their own, adding built in Safety Overrides and a Hammer Barrage to cleanse non-believers.",,,
BSC_Adventurer,SHIP,"A capital grade exploration cruiser designed for extended operation far from civilisation either alone or as part of a civilian fleet. Very few were built before the collapse due to lack of demand but now that the sector is a far less hospitable place the Adventurer has seen a resurgence in use amongst Independent Explorers and Scavengers. Despite being outmatched by military grade Capital ships, the Adventurer is still more than capable of defending itself and allies and can easily take on the Junkers, converted freighters and degraded warships prevalent amongst the Sectors more unsavory groups.",,,
BSC_Nebula_MK2,SHIP,"Another conversion by the sectors destitute undesirables and desperately poor, the Nebula MK.II changes the common liner into a light destroyer. Extra armour and weaponry has been bolted on or built into the hull. Despite this, the ships ability to take on any sort of actual military craft is nearly non-existant.",,,
BSC_Starliner_MK2,SHIP,"The Starliner MK.II is a conversion of the common passenger ship into a makeshift cruiser for use by pirate raiders and occasionally independent units. Extra armour and weaponry has been bolted onto or installed into the hull and the ships shuttle bay has been jury rigged into a fighter hangar. Despite these ""improvements"" the ship will still struggle to face off against actual military grade cruisers and even some destroyers.",,,
BSC_anti_phase,SHIP_SYSTEM,A dedicated phaseship interdiction system designed to completely overload enemy phaseships and pull them back into normal space. Generates flux on use.,,,
BSC_Maraka,SHIP,"Taking a different approach compared to other large Domain warships of the time, the Maraka is a cruiser focused more on speed and pursuit compared with the more common Dominator. Despite this the ship still maintains the trademark armour and heavy ballistic firepower of earlier Domain doctrine and is more than capable of standing up to all but the largest of enemy cruisers.",,,
BSC_Tramp_MK2,SHIP,"A desperate and cheap conversion of an already desperate and cheap freighter, the MK2 version of the Tramp is inspired by similiar conversions done to the Mudskipper. Sacrificing any logistical capability for an array of wielded on gun mounts, the Tramp MK2 can project the appearance of superior firepower though it lacks the flux and defensive capabilites to back it up usually.",,,
BSC_Kingpin,SHIP,"A late Domain design for a destroyer similiar in role to the Enforcer but incorporating many of the improvements in ship design from shortly before the collapse, the Kingpin is a bulky but surprisingly nimble destroyer with a heavy energy focused armament and a good missile compliment. Mostly used by Tri-Tachyon Security Forces post collapse, who employ it in a similiar role to the older Enforcer class.",,,
BSC_Killskipper,SHIP,"Where as the Mudskipper MK2 is typically regarded as joke amongst the captains of the sector, the Killskipper is quite the opposite. Whether it was drugs or madness that drove Pirate ""engineers"" to cobble together this design, the result is an unsafe but effective amalgamation of decent to high end parts slammed together on a Mudskipper hull. The crafts systems are extremely strained and haphazard so combat failures and flameouts are a common occurance but while the ship is working it is a dreadful foe to face.",,,
BSC_Drudge,SHIP,"A bulbous cruiser designed shortly before the collapse, the Drudge aims to field heavy, centralised energy firepower in a well defended and mobile shell. Lacking the pure speed and aggression of the Fury or the overwhelming defensive capabilities of the Aurora, the Drudge instead can focus all of its primary energy weapons on a single target and can also overcharge these weapons for improved firepower.",,,
BSC_Bitzer,SHIP,"The Bitzer is a very lightly armed but fast patrol craft intended for use by customs and police forces and designed by the same design team behind the rugged Hound freighter. It carries enough weaponry to force civilian ships and unarmed smugglers to stop and carries support PD drones for protection. Post collapse the vessel has (unforunately for its crews) been pressed into a more direct combat role, something it struggles with due to its small size and light armament and defensive capabilities. However the vessel is very cheap, abundant and very easy to field.",,,
BSC_Terringzean,SHIP,"The Terringzean is a monstrous line battleship designed to stand in the centre of Domain battlefleets. Larger than an Onslaught but smaller than a true Dreadnought, this ""heavy"" battleship lacks the Onslaughts direct firepower but makes up for it with decidedly more modular ballistic and missile options. Its large thick hull and interlocking armoured belt gives it incredible staying power and while its standard burn and combat speed leaves much to be desired, the ship is equipped with a burn drive system that can quickly allow the vessel to relocate in battle. Fielded mostly by the Hegemony and occasionally by the Luddic Church, this massive vessel is an imposing sight to see in any fleet though it falls a bit short of the size and capability of the Larger Invictus. ",,,
BSC_Baldric,SHIP,"A Cruiser sized freighter utilizing cargo container technology found in the Atlas, the Baldric is a competitor to the Colossus freighter. Sacrificing survivability for speed, the Baldric has a slight chance of escaping ambushes that the slower Colossus would be trapped in.",,,
BSC_Roamer,SHIP,"A light cruiser sized convoy escort designed for use in the Civilian Sector, the Roamer saw few buyers before the Collapse but afterwards has seen a massive surge in interest due to the prevalence of Pirate Raiders. Less tough than the slightly larger Venturer but cheaper, easier to field, faster and has (Theoretically) better direct combat capability due to the type of weaponry it mounts.",,,
BSC_Atticus,SHIP,"With the current state of the Sector and its economy, ship losses (particularly capital ship losses) can be slow and difficult to replace: especially for smaller factions and independent interests. A stop gap solution, inspired by similiar pirate conversions, is the Atticus battlecruiser. A heavily converted Atlas hull, the Atticus replaces every inch of the Atlases original cargo area with armour, weapon mounts, a slightly uprated shield generator, hangars and an uprated flux grid and generator to handle them. Like its Pirate inspiration, the vessel is fitted with an ammo feed system that can boost its firepower. While not a replacement for a proper warship, the Atticus can act as an auxillary capital and heavy escort when other capitals are unavailable.",,,
BSC_Coyote,SHIP,"Affectionally referred to as a Chunky or Fat Wolf, the Coyote-class is a rebuild of the original Wolf hull into a more potent assault frigate by an obscure private ship building company. The Coyote tries to correct the Wolfs deficiencies in Flux Capacity and staying power through extensive upgrades to hull plating, weaponry and its primary flux core and shield generator. Not as common as the Wolf, the Coyote is sometimes seen as the poor mans Tempest though it is definitely not to be underestimated.",,,
BSC_Bitzer_Drone,SHIP,A low end point defence drone integrated into the Bitzer patrol craft. This drone mounts dual machine guns for shooting down missiles and pressuring targets that get too close to its parent vessel.,,,
BSC_Lockout,SHIP,"A civilian grade escort destroyer designed for use in the civilian sector. Pre-Collapse the Lockout was a somewhat rarely bought design due to both the relative safety of trade routes and Domain anti-piracy patrols. Post collapse the vessel has seen a huge resurgence as it is an affordable alternative to the Enforcer class while still providing reasonably heavy firepower and armour. The ship comes equipped with a cannister flak system giving it increased protection from fighters and missiles, though this system is no substitute for proper point defence.",,,
BSC_Hartfell,SHIP,"A middle of the road combat frigate with a distinctive profile, decent survivability, good maneuverability and flexible mounting options. The Hartfell was designed as a light line frigate for Domain patrol fleets though the introduction of the Wolf frigate overshadowed this design. It has since seen a resurgence in use after the Collapse -particular by the Pesean League- as it is still a very capable combat frigate.",,,
BSC_Sabot_MLMS,WEAPON,"A large missile system launching trios of Sabot kinetic missiles to defeat enemy shields. Designed for large Capital ships, this rare weapon features decent ammo reserves but impressive mounting and purchasing costs.",,,
BSC_Cassina,SHIP,"Designed as a flotilla leader for overstretched Domain patrols, the Cassina combines heavy forward firepower with good mobility and cruiser level armour and hull protection though the Cassina pays for these advantages by being extremely expensive for a Destroyer. Despite being designed as an economical alternative to the Falcon, the larger cruiser was generally the preferred choice in Domain fleets due to its edge in flux capacity.",,,
BSC_Shalloch,SHIP,"A rare high-end destroyer from the late Expansion-era of ship building, this ship attempts to combine Late-Domain shield technology with the decent armour and speed of Core ship designs. The result is a mobile destroyer capable of absorbing alot of incoming fire while dishing out opportune attacks via a powerful energy and missile based armament. The ship also steals a device from the Afflictor class frigate, an entropy amplifier powered by the Shallochs large reactor. This device messes with reality, causing enemy ships to take more damage when active. The power of this destroyer is matched by its rarity, price and the cost to maintain it. ",,,
BSC_Double_Mining_Laser,WEAPON,A dual mounted mining laser that offers double the mining capability of a regular mining laser. In the unstable times faced by the Sector it often acts as a poor mans Point Defence as well.,,,
BSC_Carnyx,SHIP,"Little more than a mobile flight deck, the Carnyx is intended to provide a relatively large strike package for a low cost in comparison to other carriers in the same weight class. The price for this capability however is that the ship is left with relatively underwhelming defensive options. Weak armour and weaponry relegate this craft to a support role behind the frontline. The Carnyx always comes with a wing of built in Wasp drones for protection.",,,
BSC_Gallivanter,SHIP,"A dedicated reconnaissance and electronic warfare support frigate designed to support exploration focused operations, the Gallivanter packs powerful sensors and ECM suites into a relatively capable and well shielded frame. The main drawback of such a well equipped, almost top of the line support vessel is its high upfront cost and upkeep. Even so it is looked upon fondly by wealthier independent explorers and mercenaries.",,,
BSC_Talon_Solo_wing,SHIP,"A single, lone Talon fighter for cramming into tiny hangar bays.",,,
BSC_Bitzer_P,SHIP,"A Pirate modification to the standard Bitzer patrol craft, removing the tiny hangar and associated drones and replacing it with an integrated rack of Swarmer missiles. Whether this improves the ships usefulness is up for debate. Otherwise the ship performs roughly the same as the standard model.",,,
BSC_Threave,SHIP,"The Threave class battlecruiser was designed at a time when Domain doctrine called for heavy armour and firepower over mobility and therefore immediately ran into opposition even just at the concept stage. Compared to the Onslaught, the Threave Sacrifices heavy armour for somewhat improved mobility while retaining capital grade firepower. The Threave class was not widely adopted by the Domain Navy and those that were built were mostly relegated to leading anti-piracy operations and any future life for the class was cut short by the introduction of the Conquest class. Post collapse the ship is used by the Hegemony, who possess the blueprint and have the need for a faster Capital ship.",,,
BSC_Chrysaor,SHIP,"The Chrysaor class destroyer is an attempt to take the EMP emitter seen on the Omen class frigate and integrate it into a larger, sturdier and more capable combat vessel. The Chrysaor is on the lighter side of Destroyer class vessels but boasts a decent weapons package, flux grid and good agility and acceleration. The EMP emitter located in the middle of the hull allows the ship to either act as a premium escort or as a close range brawler using the EMP to disable enemy craft.",,,
BSC_Nadir,SHIP,"A large capital ship with a hull shape more fitting of a starbase than mobile vessel, the Nadir class is an excellent example of a Late Epoch long range explorer and survey vessel. Much like the Apogee -with whom it shares some design aspects- the Nadir is a combat rated vessel in its own right with ample weaponry and shielding but also excellent sensors and surveying equipment. Large volumes of supplies and fuel can be stored within its bulbous round hull for missions into the depths of uncharted space. A quirk of the design is that the central command and crew decks spin to generate gravity much like in ancient starship designs tho the power saved by doing this rather than traditional gravity generation is negligible.",,,
BSC_Tungustan,SHIP,"Designed to provide Domain cruiser pickets with long range anti-ship support, the Tungustan class cruiser is a vessel with a singular purpose, that is to carry the massive energy array for a long range, accurate and quite powerful Impulse Beam Cannon. Due to the energy requirements of the Beam Cannon and due to targetting interference generated by the weapon iteselt when firing, the Tungustan is equipped with only minimum provisions for modular defensive armament. Decent cruiser grade shields do provide some protection if an enemy does somehow get close enough to cruiser to threaten it but if an opponent can dodge the main beam the ship is vulnerable to attack.",,,
BSC_Impulsebeam,WEAPON,"An extremely long ranged and high powered energy beam weapon mounted solely upon dedicated Domain artillery cruisers, the Impulse Beam Array (IPA) is designed for continuous anti-ship support at stand-off distance. The weapon imparts a decent amount of gravitic force on its targets, allowing it to push any targets it cannot out-right destroy away and out of engagement range.",,,
BSC_heavyemp,SHIP_SYSTEM,A larger and more potent EMP system mounted on a destroyer sized frame. The arcs on this device are more powerful than standard arrays but comes at the cost of increased cooldown.,,,
BSC_Bogle,SHIP,"A light gunship designed by Tri-Tachyon Corporation to be a cheap, disposable escort for more irreplaceable vessels, the Bogle-class is actually a nimble and suprisingly capable combatant that can fill both support and general combat roles. The notably small size of this vessels hull has led to speculation that the ship was actually designed to be piloted by an AI control core, though such theories have never been officially confirmed.",,,
BSC_Boggart,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it. The Boggart is an AI controlled version of the Bogle Light Gunship. The lack of an organic crew allows the replacement of life support and other redundant subsystems with a slightly improved Flux Core and an energy focusing system, giving the Boggart improved staying power and firepower over the lesser crewed version.",,,
BSC_Preybird,SHIP,"Designed to operate as a light battlecarrier that could keep pace with Falcon and Eagle cruisers, the Preybird is a relatively mobile and capable vessel with decent firepower and two fighter wings. This vessel is quite rare and is primarily operated by the Persean League and occasionally by Independent mercenaries.",,,
BSC_Baldric_MK2,SHIP,"Inspired by the Buffalo Mk.II, the Baldric MK.II is a derived class based on a heavily modified Baldric Freighter. This vessel is heavily modified away from its basic hull. Armour plating has been added to the sides of the hull and the cargo holds and container racks have been removed, replaced instead by grafted on missile mountings. The original inefficent shield generator has also been removed, reducing strain on the flux grid. Much like the Buffalo Mk.II this ship excels as a support craft but will quickly falter against dedicated combat vessels. ",,,
BSC_Hammerhead_MK2,SHIP,"Inspired by common Pirate modifications to the Falcon Cruiser and uparming ships like the Colossus and Mudskipper, the Hammerhead MK.II is a somewhat heavily modified, pirate engineered derivative of the common Hammerhead destroyer. Through a combination of blueprint hacking and good old fashioned manual labour this Hammerhead has been modified to incorporate a variety of ""upgrades"". Salvaged and aftermarket engine components serve to increase the ships speed while the front missile mounts have been removed, rewielded and replaced by a single larger mount. In theory these changes serve to make the ship faster and more lethal at the cost of increasing the vessels logistics requirements and reducing overall hull structural integrity.",,,
BSC_Carnal,SHIP,"The Carnal-class is an older heavy frigate design, a tough and well armed combatant that often outlasts other frigates in battle due to its armour and thick hull plating. The ship saw use in smaller Domain strike groups pre-collapse and sees use in Hegemony and independent units post-collapse.",,,
BSC_Maraka_LP,SHIP,"A Maraka-class cruiser retroffitted by the Luddic Path into a more effective weapon of holy war. A Hammer Barrage launcher has been built into the front of the vessel and the front small missiles have been creatively rebuilt to house larger launchers. Additional engines have been grafted on, increasing the base speed at the cost of two of the rear point defence turrets. All of these modifications have slightly compromised the ships hull and armour and make the vessel a bit harder to field and maintain but the ship fits much better into the Luddic Paths needs",,,
BSC_Drone_PD,SHIP,"A small, fragile drone equipped with a long ranged point defence laser and little else.",,,
BSC_Drone_PD,SHIP_SYSTEM,A small drone bay can be used to launch small point defence drones that will help to protect the ship from fighters and missiles. Replenishes slowly.,,,
BSC_Constable,SHIP,"An ancient superheavy destroyer design from the same period as the Vanguard frigate, the Constable class is a heavy brawler and flotilla leader dating from the same era as early versions of the Onslaught class battleship. Although, much like the Vanguard, the ship was retired from frontline Domain usage, post collapse the vessel has come back into circulation particular amongst the Luddic Church who make use of it's unsophisticated easily maintained brawn to crush their enemies. Despite it's incredibly tough design and heavy armour, lack of modern shielding does leave it vulnerable to modern long range energy weapons.",,,
BSC_Preybird_LP,SHIP,"A Preybird-class battlecarrier retrofitted by the Luddic Path to better suit their aggressive doctrine. The hangars have been completely replaced with an array of heavy weapons mounts, transforming this ship into a fast, aggressive cruiser sized gunship. The installation of additional weaponry has damaged the hull and has compromised both the armour scheme and the original ammo feed system. However additional engines have been added as a compromise, boosting speed and maneuvrability. The original Preybird is a relatively rare sight, so these converted Luddic Path versions are even rarer, which many sector Captains are thankful for.",,,
BSC_Cumulus,SHIP,"A light destroyer focused around exploration, recon and light support for civilian fleets, the Cumulus class takes many cues from the much larger Apogee just scaled down into a smaller, easier to afford and maintain hull. In combat the Cumulus may lack mounting options but has generous system capabilities allowing it to mount a variety of hull modifications.",,,
BSC_Covetor,SHIP,"Originally a dedicated mining ship, the deteriorating conditions of the sector has seen the hardy Covetor-class pushed into service as a general combat and support frigate. The ships heritage is shown in its uncommon (atleast on ships this basic) energy weaponry and energy focusing system that were originally for carving up asteroids, now used for carving up pirates instead.",,,
BSC_Roamer_LP,SHIP,"Roamer class cruisers that come into the possession of the Luddic Path are either used as is or are sometimes ""upgraded"" into this more heavily armed Luddic Path raider version. Weapon mounts have been grafted to the hull, some additional armour has been wielded onto weak points and the ships engines have been upgraded with salvaged parts, though these changes come at the cost of damaging both the flux grid and the ships overall hull integrity. The resulting ship is a far more heavily armed raider than the original, a fitting weapon of holy war.",,,
BSC_Lockout_LP,SHIP,"Lockout class destroyers that come into the possession of the Luddic Path are either used as is or are sometimes ""upgraded"" into this drastically up-armed and up-engined variant. The Luddic Path version of the Lockout sacrifices hull integrity, armour and many of its original weapons for speed and an oversized frontal mount capable of unleashing tremendous barrages on unsuspecting victims.",,,
BSC_Brigand,SHIP,"The wildest fears of traders and patrol commanders made reality, the Brigand-class is a pirate built battlecruiser designed for swift raiding attacks against protected convoys and smaller patrols. The ship is technically a junker-hull (in that it is built from a mixture of salvaged and fabricated components) but it is a standardised hull design that has been constructed to a reasonably high standard in hidden pirate shipyards beyond the edges of civilised space. This ship is fast and heavily armed but the vessels somewhat flimsy frame and weak shield generator leave it a bit lacking in terms of defence.",,,
BSC_Accipiter,SHIP,The Accipiter-class destroyer is a light combat carrier with enough armament and defensive capability that it can wade directly into battle. Being able to fight comes at the cost of carrying capacity. As such the Accipiter only brings one wing of fighters to the field though it can sortie reserve craft to briefly increase its strike capabilities.,,,
BSC_Sword,SHIP,"A high end heavy frigate with impressive defensive capabilities, a deep flux pool and an energy focusing system, the Sword-class is a menace to enemy frigates and can project enough firepower to threaten even destroyer grade vessels. Such capabilities come at a steep cost for a frigate and the ship also lacks rear point defence capability. Mostly operated by the Persean League and occasionally by Independent units.",,,
