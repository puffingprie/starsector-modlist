sikr_lehal,SHIP,"Highly specialised frigate built around a small nanoforge supplied by a deconstructor beam. This configuration allows the Lehal to manufacture missiles continuously throughout a battle, provided it can 'access' the materials to power the forge.",,,
sikr_vine,SHIP,"Highly specialized frigate built around a double-barreled autocannon directly connected to the ship's autoforge. The Vine is a sister project to the Lehal, both trying to exploit the advantages of a frigate-sized autoforge.",,,
sikr_himin,SHIP,"The Himin is designed to fit nicely in small and large fleets, the central mount allows the ship to fill many roles. Often used as a point defense platform.",,,
sikr_dufa,SHIP,A strong frigate capable of tearing apart other ships of its size with its heavy frontal firepower. Captains of this ship have a notorious tendancy to attack larger targets and often pay the price of such recklessness.,,,
sikr_shion,SHIP,"Converted from a failed prototype for a phase carrier, the Shion has ample hangar space from the place once used by the phase coil. Its past also grants this ship impressive speed for a carrier.",,,
sikr_nuyre,SHIP,"Designed to be used as a spec-ops ship, the Nyure make use of a in-house modified phase coil. The weapon complement is small and prioritizes alpha strike.",,,
sikr_bara,SHIP,"A main fleet destroyer, the Bara adds useful firepower to weaker part of the fleet but performs poorly when its the largest ship on its side of the battle.",,,
sikr_echin,SHIP,A dedicated escort ship using an emp emitter to intercept fighter and missiles. The Echin can also hunt smaller craft by overwhelming them with emp arc.,,,
sikr_marus,SHIP,"The Marus is a large scavanging platform capable of recovering even the most out of reach valuables. Carrying precious cargo, its fighter escort provides ample support should it find itself in combat. San-Iris uses these salvagers to recover their lost ships after battle.",,,

sikr_palace,SHIP,"A palace-ship, from which one can watch a battle in the comfort of a castle and its gardens, protected by an armoured canopy and guaranteed to escape in phase. A true symbol of the hypocrisy of the nobility. Few were built and today there is only one left, the Empress's dedicated ship, which is rarely seen during major events.",,,
sikr_ocean,SHIP,"Specially designed to go underwater and withstand high pressure, while carrying magnetically locked containers.

sikr_horonn,SHIP,"The Horron was designed as a hunter, carrying two precision rifles with fragmentation bullets. It can easily shoot down other fighters and pose a threat to small ships. Although slightly slow, it only needs to hit its target once or twice, and its accelerated loading system increases the chances of this happening.",,,
sikr_hefring,SHIP,"Heavy variant of the San-Iris mechs. The Hefring carries 2 heavy anti-ship weapons, which can counter armor and shields. Equipped with a shield to be able to stay longer in the fight. It is easy to consider this fighter as a mobile artillery piece. ",,,
