1.8.14
Decaying Armory changed to increase weapon flux generation instead of reducing weapon damage, accordingly point bonus has been changed from 4 to 3 (still a very big downside on ships with lots of weapon slots)
Hopefully fixed Synergistic Fleet (AGAIN)

1.8.13
Hotfix to hopefully make Synergistic Fleet work properly

1.8.12
Fixed the issue where Loulan fighters did not require crew (besides the Mist)
(Hopefully) fixed the issue where the Mist was not able to be installed on automated ships

1.8.11
Added and adjusted UNGP rules
Tweaked the two main LLI Protocols
A round of nerfs to destroyers/frigates due to hullmod buffs
*NOT THE FINAL NERFS*
[Ships]
River:                         Speed 120>100, Dissipation 120>100 (it's a survey ship, shouldn't be that strong in combat anyways)

Magma:                         Capacity 7000>6000
Hanba:                         Shield eff. 0.6>0.7

[Hullmods]
Cliff System                   Base mode overall effects increased by 50%; buff to missile speed/maneuver changed into debuff
LLI Rifleman Protocol          Zero-flux speed boost will be increased by an amount equal to the speed debuff, range boost 75/150/225/300>100/200/300/400
LLI Commando Protocol          Zero-flux speed boost will be reduced by an amount equal to the speed buff (nobody uses it, anyways)

1.8.10
Altered the "questline" to allow some limited exchange with the NPC. More will be added in the future
New UNGP rule: Synergistic Fleet, having multiple copies of the flagship in a fleet will reduce the DP of those ships (including the flagship itself)

Eruption Vectoring: Flux generated per use 500->300
Thunder Charge: Duration increased by 2s, no longer forces ship to accelerate, reduce frequency of arc generation (meaning the arcs generate more steadily over the duration of the system rather than all at once), adjusted system AI

1.8.6
Balance adjustments and feature (bug) fixes, code adjustments: 
Adjusted descriptions of "Phase Splinter" and "Focused Ammo Feeder"
Adjusted default variants to be better; though considering the random nature of NPC autofit, it's not necessarily an enhancement...
New weapon - Lop Nor Cruise MIRV

[Ship Systems]
Catastrophe Beacon: slightly reduced attraction effect (invisible to the naked eye), target damage taken bonus 25%>10% , alteration effect: attractionincrease > damage increase effect from 10% to 20%
Phase Transfer Field: Attempted to make it so it doesn't damage friendly NPCs, tweaked the code to make the AI treat it more like a Damper Field, fixed the bug where the visual effect would only take effect once.
                      Arc damage 200>400, EMP 2000>1000

[Hullmods]
Changed the description of the alteration for unstable energy focus to avoid confusion

New weapon! Smart-Flare Pod, PD weapon that launches guided flares
Mirage Astropolis now has an industry similar to the Lion's Guard HQ
【Hullmods】
Beam mode reworked!!! Now requires a specific "Beam Mode Conversion" hullmod (cost is the same as HSA) to enable.

                  Alteration: System duration 14->21s, each ballistic weapon provides 1->2s additional acceleration time
                  Optimization: system duration 14->10s
