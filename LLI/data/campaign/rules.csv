The spaceport is quite orderly: no vendors hawking on the sidewalks, advertisements on the walls, and the various stores are luxuriously decorated without exception. After leaving the spaceport's magnificient reception, you can finally get a glimpse of the \""downtown\"" of the Mirage Astropolis. It's as bustling as Old Earth's cities (as seen in holodocs and games): massive windows spilling starlight evenly on every road, colorful gardens placed between tall buildings, and some carefully pruned trees flanking the road; this is obviously the city's most affluent district.""marketFlavorTextColor",,,

The port is all-but vacuum, with vendors swarming out of airtight pods whenever they catch a new ship docking, projecting holographic advertisements and trying in vain to get sound into your ears. This old spaceport sits at the bottom of the astropolis, with a giant elevator capable of taking people to any level: besides the top, that is.""marketFlavorTextColor",,,

In fact, there are no brokers for trading any other goods besides metal and ores to be found. After some investigation, you learn that all local commerce on Adenium Obesum, besides the metal and ore trade, is concentrated in residential markets: all merchants travel to trade their goods in the residential areas, rather than at the spaceport.""marketFlavorTextColor",,,

A handful of speculators who all seem to know each other crowd offloading ship captains as they arrive while peddlers call out to crew, holding wares and projecting personal ad-holos. A number of brand new monitors have been installed, displaying military propaganda and encouraging all visitors to join the LouLan Navy.""marketFlavorTextColor",,,

The Association didn't modify the Wave very much in producing their Condensation-class, but our eggheads sure went wild when they made the Heatwave-class I'm sure you've seen all over; people didn't even realize it was a modified Curtain Rain until they were told about it! But the Association's Director marveled at how creative we were in so doing.""
