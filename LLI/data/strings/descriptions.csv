ssp_wave,SHIP,"The Wave-class is a cheap and effective carrier, which is more suited to the frontlines than a standard carrier platform.",,,
ssp_karni,SHIP,"The result of the LouLan Navy retrofitting an ancient carrier design dating back to a similar time period as the venerable Onslaught's introduction, the Karni-class not only retains its original heavy armor, but also includes a number of advanced energy weapon systems. The sight of a behemoth with heavy armor activating a Damper Field to defend itself while charging towards its enemies, accompanied by a swarm of fighters: the maximized intimidation factor gives it a significant advantage in psychological warfare.",,,
ssp_vortexing,SHIP,"A versatile frigate with a wide range of uses, the Gyre-class’s greatest asset is its powerful HE missile launcher and accompanying tactical system, which enables it to not only have excellent combat effectiveness in smaller battles, but also effectively eliminate enemy ships in large-scale combat.",,,
ssp_elnino,SHIP,"The El Niño-class is the most versatile battleship in the Loulan Navy, possessing strong firepower and excellent mobility. The El Niño is a refitted Conquest, having been heavily modified and given a coat of red and white paint. A group of pirates have been attempting to convince the populace that the two are completely different. Surely, if they repeat it enough, it will gradually become accepted as the truth.",,,
ssp_vocaino,SHIP,"A destroyer equipped with a large weapon mount, such a thing is rare for ships in its size bracket. According to the LouLan Navy's records, approximately 70% of the Volcano-class destroyers in service are assigned to fire support - explaining their low casualty rate.",,,
ssp_lanina,SHIP,"When dealing with local pirates and raiders, The La Niña-class always plays an important role. As a cruiser specially designed for hunting smaller and weaker foes, it is equipped with capital-scale propulsion, light armor and a specialized tactical system to obtain ultra-high mobility and speed.",,,
ssp_wasteland,SHIP,"The Wasteland-class visually resembles the Hammerhead, the primary difference being that the ""hammer"" part of the ship has a more robust structure. The ship is a favorite among the LouLan navy, and many Wasteland captains have a metallic replica of the ship on their desk.",,,
ssp_tide,SHIP,The Tide-class is designed to launch an inordinate amount of fighters while maintaining a constant presence on the front lines.,,,
ssp_tide_T,SHIP,"A variant of the Tide-class carrier, the ""T-type"" is a missile cruiser that mounts a pair of Terminator drone wings; the vast majority of the flight decks were otherwise removed and replaced with mounting points for missiles.",,,
ssp_seaquake,SHIP,"The Seaquake-class is the most versatile cruiser in the LouLan Navy. Together with a balanced loadout, powerful firepower, and an excellent shield it is the bane of any enemy of the LouLan Navy.",,,
ssp_wave_M,SHIP,"An alternative model of the Wave-class, this modification removes the flight decks but installs heavy missile armament in their place. Though not employed by the Loulan Navy (or anyone else), it's rumored the blueprints are still in use.",,,
ssp_tronado,SHIP,"The Tornado-class invokes it’s namesake with a great number of large slots, multiple flight decks and heavy armor. It turns into a terrible tornado on the battlefield and ruthlessly destroys any defensive line.",,,
ssp_flood,SHIP,"The Flood-class is the perfect collision between modern advanced technology and a classic time-tested design. This battleship embodies the phrase “The best defense is a good offense”, with heavy front-focused firepower, but poor defensive capabilities.",,,
ssp_combustion,SHIP,A heavy frigate with fierce firepower and a robust hull. Its invisible flames cannot be ignored.,,,
ssp_flame,SHIP,"This light destroyer specializes in assaults, and often undertakes pursuit tasks alongside La Niña-clas cruisers. They shine in the hands of a commander willing to take full advantage of their superior mobility.",,,

ssp_thunder,SHIP,"Combining the powerful shields of LouLan ships with excellent armor and firepower, the Ball Lightning-class serves as a powerful line ship in the LouLan Navy.",,,
ssp_turbulence,SHIP,"This heavy destroyer is mainly responsible for defensive patrols.

ssp_hanba,SHIP,"The Hanba-class was retrofitted from another ship class. The ship is proof of the close relationship between the LouLan Navy and the Lion’s Guard. Although opinions of the origin of this warship differ, there is no doubt to its effectiveness on the field, and its ability to drown its opponent in a tide of missiles.",,,
ssp_conduit,SHIP,A heavy gunship equipped with energy weapons. Uses an advanced damper field instead of shields.,,,
ssp_undergroundfire,SHIP,"A light cruiser that can carry a considerable number of energy weapons, the Magma possesses disproportionate firepower for its size. According to the Loulan Navy's statistics, approximately 80% of the Magma-class ships in service utilize a pair of Blazing Torii, a fact likely related to the ship's weak flux grid.",,,
ssp_dew,SHIP,"The standard frigate of the LouLan Navy. Besides its cheapness and ease of maintenance, the Dew-class's biggest strength is its considerable energy firepower without needing extensive configuration.",,,
ssp_yu_lian,SHIP,"Apparently, the Heatwave-class destroyer was derived from another class of ship. It was officially a peaceful technological exchange; but some theorize that it was stolen from a heavily guarded research facility by an agent risking their lives: it's hard to imagine just how drunk one would have to be to create such a crackpot theory. This 'La Mini-ña' focuses on frontal firepower; much like the Flood-class, it lacks defense and must strive to use its firepower to uphold the saying that ""the best defense is a good offense"".",,,
ssp_zhurong,SHIP,"An advanced gunship with impressive firepower and excellent maneuverability, this frigate was named after a god of fire from an ancient Old Earth myth. Though the ship looks similar to the Vigilance-class frigate, the two are completely unrelated.",,,

ssp_solareclipse,WEAPON,"The origin of this plasma weapon can be traced back to the very first spaceborne energy weapons produced. While the Plasma Cannon is notoriously complicated, this weapon simply uses a binding field to fix the hot plasma into a circular shell, greatly improving the stability of the shell, thus obtaining a longer range and greater flight speed.",,,

The bombs are equipped with a separation charge, allowing them to reach a greater velocity and wider distribution the instant they separate from the missile.",,,
ssp_ChaosArmory,WEAPON,"A large multi-missile launcher. This weapon was originally designed as a ""smart"" missile launcher that automatically selected the type of missiles to fire based on its target's weaknesses: however, a critical error in the weapon's algorithms caused it to instead load different types at random. Strangely, the Loulan Navy actually enjoyed the random nature of the weapon, leading to it being fielded as-is.",,,
ssp_GPD,WEAPON,The six barrels of this autocannon can exert a powerful suppressive force against shields over a short burst.,,,
ssp_BigFackingGPD,WEAPON,"The larger, more powerful, version. A specially-designed particle gas chamber is required to produce the particle clusters fired by this weapon, with maintenance requiring special technicians familiar with particle technology: this complexity also makes it very difficult to install onto a ship.",,,

LLI,FACTION,"LouLan Industries is an organization established after the Collapse: they were once part of the Persean League.

127 years after the collapse, Mirage SouthWind, CEO of SouthWind Metals Corporation, which controls Adenium Obesum SouthWind found that staying in the Persean League would only allow corrupt warlords and dictators to drain them of value till there was nothing left, and only leaving the Persean League could allow them a chance to survive in the chaotic post-Collapse Sector. So he united a great deal of arms dealers, factory owners, smugglers, and even pirates to establish LouLan Industries and announced their secession from the Persean League. Although the official law within the Persean League states that no Persean League members may force any other member to stay in the League, LouLan has been sanctioned by more than a few of their former partners as well as the League's ally, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.

Since the Collapse, LouLan’s top leaders have been replaced several times. They attempt to keep a low profile to avoid an all out war with the other powerful factions in the sector but it remains to be seen when the time for peace ends.",,,
