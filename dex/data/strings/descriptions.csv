DEX_barrier,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

If a Barrier drone even counts as an independent ship is questionable. Little more than a slab of thick armor with manuvering thrusters and paltry point defence, this simplistic escort bears more in common with staiton defence drones than with most actual ships. Still, since it is little more than a flying slab of armor, the drone is exceedingly durable, and its' propensity to act as a 'human' shield for larger Explorarium drones can make it a profoundly aggrivating escort vessel.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

In principle an upscaled Barrier designed with the exact same function in mind, the Blockade makes significantly better use of its' upscaling than most similar Explorarium designs. Fitting several actual weapons, as well as even more heavy armor than its' diminutive counterpart, the intended combat role of the Blockade remains functionally identical. Which is to say, it attempts to fly directly into enemy guns with a suicidal abbadon that makes the Berserker look restrained. Cannonfodder, throguh and through.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The unmodified original-spec Larder drone differs little from its' civilianized counterpart. Other than the pointless addition of a bridge, all that really changes is the exact details of its' carrying capacity and logistical footprint. That said, as the exact shape of that footprint is what brought this little drone into the public eye in the first place, perhaps it is worth considering after all.",,,

The Homestead's data file suggests that it is a distant grand-uncle of the modern Shepard, the result of the Ko Combine being contracted to produce a lightweight drone control hub for the Domain Explorarium in the program's heyday. Evidently, the need to design a self-sufficient platform capable of functioning on the far side of the Orion-Perseus void without support played a significant part in the development of the base platform underpinning the modern Shepard. In modern times, scavenged schematics for the drone, despite being nominally illegal, seem to consistently find their way into the hands of independent groups, as the idea of a completely automated and even cheaper to operate Shepard is a very enticing prospect to any pirate or scavenger with a willingness to skirt Hegemony law.",,,

The Bailey began life as an up-gunned Pallisade developed by Tachyon Industries, the ancient precursor to the Tri-Tachyon corporation we know today. As befitting of a product designed by the people who went on many centures later to develop machines like the Terminator Drone, the Bailey is one of the nastier low-level wardrones in the Explorarium database. Initially engineered as a support ship, the impressive broadside missile-launch capability the Bailey brings to the table, when combined with its' inherited agility and flexible main armiment, means that these drones were frequently repurposed as devastating barrage frigates even in AI hands, with learning algorithims discovering that filling the ship's missile mounts with high-yield torpedos had the potential for inflicting major casualties in a cost-efficient manner after an event around c-702 where a group of rebels attempting to attack an Explorarium resource operation were wiped out to a man by a single Bailey outfitted for mining duty with a plethora of Hammer torpedos.

While it lacks the infuriating agility and speed of the Pallisade, the Bailey is among the most heavily armed of Explorarium frigates, and its' variable missile compliment makes it something to be underestimated at the spacer's own peril.",,,

Effectively an oversized automated dropship, this drone is effectively a more tactically flexible and reusible version of the Siege Tower troop lander drone, and as such while it cannot actually support non-machine units, is nonetheless useful in ground support roles.",,,

A thrusting spear to the hammer of the Warden, the Pallisade Hunter-Killer drone brings a smilar heavy armiment to bear, but in a significantly more aggressive manner. Effectively little more than an oversized engine modue with a ballistic turret mount, the Pallisade boasts a ludicrious top speed that allows it to easily chase down and slaughter unshielded smallcraft with a powerful and flexible rotary cannon. What the design lacks in durability, it makes up for in sheer efficiency and raw attack power.

All of this put together has resulted in the Pallisade becoming one of the Explorarium designs that remains the most relevant in modern times, proving that sometimes the best solution really is the simpliest one.",,,

A suprise addition to an Explorarium contract bidding at the last moment by a previously unheard of company, this oddly squat little mass of heavy firepower remains as said corporation's only significant contribution to the world of warship design. This has resulted in the strange little drone finding a place in the hangars of many ship collectors over the centuries, despite being far from worth the price tag they are often sold for.",,,

An Explorarium Construction Drone is about as humble as it is possible to get. These vessels actually come in several makes with mild differences between them. The Mbkae-Gogel varient sports an abnormally capable AI core that skirts the line between Gamma and Beta-class (though by modern classifications it is more akin to a Delta-class) for example, while the Ko Combine varient (the most commonly seen one) features a small fabrication bay capable of deploying subdrones. However, the general principle remains unchanged, a Construction Drone is a large space multipurpose space utility vehicle armed with a variety of high-lift manipulators and assembly tools that is used as something of a space-based Mobile Construction Vehicle by the Explorarium, 'unpacking' into a central assembly spire that can rapidly build out sub-facilities to assist in the construction of whatever infrastructure project it has been tasked with.

Alternatively, the highly-automated general-purpose toolset can be used for destructive purposes instead, breaking down hull and armor alike with an endless array of cutting torches and assembly arms. However, the relative fragility of the drone ensures that it can only do such things with salvage material that can no longer shoot back. Similar to manned Construction Rigs, the Construction Drone is frequently hacked and used as a salvage rig by enterprising spacers willing to skirt AI law.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

It was often wondered what, exactly, the phase coil the Gremlin test rig was prototyping was ultimately planned for. The answer, evidently, was the Haunt Drone. Seemingly the Domain's early solution to the trouble of psychological aftereffects with phase coils was to simply automate the craft using them. No crewmen, no psychotic breaks. What they did not anticipate was that computers are just as disinclined to Phase Space as living beings. AI 'pilots' in these drones would often develop erratic behaviors and actively attempt to avoid using their coils wherever possible, developing the original phase 'skim' technique as a means of spending as little time with the coil active as possible, something that only doomed more of their kind to be sent to the same fate as this massively increased the Haunt's tactical mobility above its' already high-mark performance.

Even in modern times, Haunt drones are almost never directly controlled by an actual Explorarium AI Core, and even the simplistic onboard computers still behave erratically when ordered to activate the drone's phase coil.",,,
DEX_wendigo,SHIP,"An ill-fated design from the start, the Wendigo is the original heavy assault droneship, whose unmitigated failure eventually evolved into the loathed penal ship known as the Grendel. The Wendigo was engineered with routine extensive damage and heavy casualties as a given. The ship is a brawler which can phase-shift through a first wave of hostile ordnance to appear in the midst of the enemy battle line ready to unleash missiles and heavy firepower. As with all phase ships, doing this manuver relies on carefully juggling flux-load and positioning, a difficult task even for a superhuman AI. Though both its' design and service record indicates that the Wendigo achieves superior performance by simply removing the 'safely' part of that equation.

The brainchild of an eccentric admiral who managed to capture procurement authority over an entire frontier sector, the Wendigo was directly developed from the Haunt drone, only a handful of generations into phase coil development. The ship's very first deployments instantly displayed exactly how bad of an idea it was. The AIs became rapidly unstable, even erratic, after only a handful of phase shifts. While the Domain immediately enacted a series of coverups and reworked the project to be crewed by prisoners. Meanwhile, the original Wendigoes, still under the command of completely unhinged AI captains, quietly vanished into the depths of space. Never removed from the construction database of the Explorarium, the Wendigo prototype continued to be constructed, and crewed by hapless Explorarium AIs that invariably turned berzerk sometimes on their very first activation, the grizzly name of the ship class has become frighteningly fitting, as this horror of deep space has been a boogeyman since long before the collapse.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Berserker V2 is almost identical to the Berserker V1 save for one crucial alteration: The large gap in the frontal section of the V1 has been filled in with a massive cannon hardpoint, with a tiny scattering of point defence turrets placed across the hull as an afterthought. Make no mistake though, this machine is still just as aggressive as the V1, save that unlike the V1 it has the firepower to back up that aggression. It is often questioned if the 'V2' Berserker is even an actual iteration on the design, or just some sort of advanced prototype that was found to be lesser than the more common varient in some way.

Many a spacer has met an untimely end by assuming that a Berserker could be easily disreguarded on its' 'suicidal' reputation, only to have their hull ripped apart by a withering frontal barrage from a machine designed from the ground up to kill as efficiently as possible.",,,

This utilitarian (read: crude and ugly) droneship appears to be the result of a frightening concept: an Exploratorium Gamma AI seemingly deciding to design and produce a unique original ship design completely devoid of any human interference. The exact intent of this design is hard to divine beneath the illogical tangles of conduit and uncanny internal cavities endemic to AI design process, but it appears to be a multipurpose cruiser that utilizes an advanced nanotechnology-based repair system in conjunction with weapons systems that seem to bear startling resemblance to the high-tech energy weapons used by Tri-Tachyon during the First AI War. If this is the result of cross-polination between artificial intelligences or simply convergent evolution is currently unknown.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Derived from the civilian Tarsus-class freighter, the Tartar was designed as a hazard-duty transport for carrying volatile materials and/or travelling through hazardous regions sucn as the inner systems around Red Giants or poorly charted asteroid fields. However,  Its' lighter transport capacity compared to the more common Stockpile drone makes it a rare sight, a the Explorarium's computers consider it a sub-optimal unit in the majority of situations.

As a result, when a Tartar drone is seen, it can be almost garunteed that it is carrying something that the Explorarium has designated as a 'high-importantce item'. And while the actual value of the item in question is *not* garunteed, the mere potential for finding some priceless Domain-Restricted artifact in the drone's hold is more than enough to entice all sorts of scavengers... unfortuantely for them, in order to claim their prize, they still have to contend with the powerful guns of the Tartar itself, and many a scavenger has met their end trying to break this mechanical nut open.",,,

The Bore-class High Energy Weapons Platform began life as a humble mining rig equipped with an early-mark mining beam similar to modern high-intensity lasers. However, it seems that at some point one Domain beuracrat or another found its' powerful reactor and the massive mounting point for the main laser having a high-capacity conduit leading directly from the main reactor to make the Bore an ideal canidate for testing experimental high-energy weapons systems. The result is a compact but dangerous destroyer known to suprise many a Pirate with weapons far more advanced than Exploratorium standard.",,,
DEX_antiphase,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Most infamous among them are a series of significantly more advanced drones that began to mysteriously appear well after the majority of Domain drone forces were nominally decomissioned. These experimental hulls are seemingly the result of secretive Domain weapons-testing projects that used the old drone fleet as a low-cost test platform. These experimental hulls are significantly more sophisticated and dangerous than their disposable Explorarium bretheren, and should generally be prioritized over lesser drones when decomissioning Explorarium assets.

The uncannily sleek and disturbingly advanced look of this drone betrays its nature. The Antephaylax is one of many ""advanced"" drones inserted into Explorarium databases post-hoc in an attempt to test experimental high-tech Domain weapons on deniable targets. In this case, the drone was designed to counter phase vessels, using a hulking mark one Acasual Disruptor to remotely overload the coils of a phase warship and force it out of P-space, and directly into the firing line of the drone's powerful main gun. While similar technology still exists within the Sector, it is interestingly only mounted on phase vessels now. This, seemingly, is due to a strong cultural push within the Domain Navy that argued that the only real way to counter a phase ship was by using another phase ship, thus consigning the Antephaylax and other designs like it to the dustbin of history.",,,
DEX_bastillon2,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Bastillon M2 is exactly what it seems, an upgraded, upgunned and up-armored Bastillon drone. Legend goes that the M2 was developed in a single night after an angry phone call from Explorarium Mission Control informed Mbaye-Gogol that their 'uparmed defender' was lacking in meaningful striking power while simultaneously serving as the backbone of more than half of the Explorarium's warfleets. The M2 features two large armor plates covering over the M1's relatively fragile 'spokes', and exchanges two of the Small point defence mounts of the original for larger Medium mounts in the hopes of bringing appropriate destroyer-scale firepower to the infamously undergunned drone.

Of course, the construction routines of the Exploratorium Armada neither know nor care for this, and both versions of the drone frequently appear side-by-side in Exploratorium formations.",,,
DEX_brigadeer,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Expanding forwards from where the hasty development of the Bastillon M2 left off, the Brigadier was developed by Mbaye-Gogol in an attempt to recoup on the rather embaressing launch of the Bastillon for minimal further cost to the company. They were fortunate in that the M2 left significant empty tonnage on the drone's underlying structure, allowing for the development of a significantly more extensive armiment that even by modern standards is rather competent.  Fast and loaded with extensive Medium mounts the Brigadier was accused at the time of its' unveiling of being 'just a green Enforcer knockoff', though with the model that is seen throughout the Sector now it is somewhat difficult to see why. Perhaps there was a redesign at some point in the vessel's development. 

Nonetheless, this nimble destroyer-drone makes for a striking front-facing combatant within Explorarium Directories, and as a result tends to be rendered inoperable rather frequently, resulting in a significant number of these machines being reactivated with hacked firmware in service of would-be pirate warlords and 'freedom fighters'.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Siege Tower is the ultimate expression of how expendable the Explorarium truly were, a troop lander that is flat-out not designed to take off again after landing. During planetary invasions, Siege Towers will hot-drop onto a planet in the hundreds, slamming themselves into resistance centers with devastating, nuclear-grade results. In the aftermath of the impact, a Siege Tower will convert itself into a static planetside fortress equipped with starship-scale weapons and armor, capable of churning out division after division of ground units and strikecraft to drown the planet's defenders under sheer weight of numbers, creating a near unassailible beachhead and occupation center.

Once the invasion is over, Siege Towers will generally be abandoned where they lay, or converted into planetary occupation centers. Many worlds ironically hack these facilities after the Explorarium's departure and convert them into planetary defense installations. Although doing such a thing is incredibly illegal under Domain law, and is considered a grave sin by the Luddic Church, the vast array of automated war machines a still-functioning Seige Tower's manufactury can provide are more than enough of a carrot to outweigh those sticks for many of the outer worlds in the sector.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Befitting its' origin, the Guardhouse is a very basic design that shares more than 70% of its' modular construction with the Berserker drone, and hulls can take repair parts from either class and be easily converted from one to the other accordingly. The difference comes in the form of the once cutting-edge miniaturized autofactory the drone sports that allows it to assemble child-units on-site from a schematic database, creating effectively an Exploratorium factory ship writ small... and one of the earliest instances of modern semi-industrial carrier doctrine on record.

The Guardhouse is one of many products of the Domain's use of the Explorarium as a testbed for new military technologies, but not in the conventional manner. During the early days of modern carrier development, the Strategic Council wanted to use the Explorarium to test several experimental combat drones, but ran into a rather embaressing problem after several years of no combat data for their new designs being reported: the Exploratorium did not have any wardrones capable of supporting child-units the way the Domain wanted. Deeply embaressed, the Domain hastily created the Guardhouse in-house and uploaded it to the database less than two weeks after it was first put to paper.",,,

The original-specification Stockpile differs significantly from its' civilianized counterpart. With a higher carrying capacity, technically better armament, and fully automated hull, this vessel is... still not dangerous, but perhaps less of a pushover than its' counterpart.",,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Barracks was a rather late addition to the Explorarium schematics databases. Derived from a grand-uncle of the modern Mora and automated by Standard Transplutonics, this spaceborne manufacturing plant takes the quantity-over-quality approach the Domain applied so frequently to their drones a step further, manufacturing fighter-scale drone-craft on-site and deploying them en-masse into combat. Most of the fighter servicing equipment more commonly found on a carrier is notably missing, in favor of more manufacturing and launching equipment, as the survival rates of drone fighters in combat, even in the Explorarium's heyday, were virtually nil.",,,

The Anvil to the Rampart's Hammer, the Trench is a tough, heavily armored defense-oriented support drone designed to compliment its' more common cousin. Even with its' heavy armor and damper field, heavy losses were anticipated in this role, and similarly to the Rampart the Trench was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities. Technically speaking, both hulls feature cross-compatible modules that can be used interchangibly, but the resulting hulls have unpredictable performance and their AI cores tend  to behave erratically, prompting the introduction of a 'correction' function that is supposed to see these hybrid-drones dismantled when discovered.",,,

The Bastard Child of the Hammer and Anvil of the Exploratorium, a 'Trepart' is not a ship class per-say, so much as it is the emergent result of modules from a Rampart and Trench being cross-contaminated during a post-battle repair sequence. Automated protocols are supposed to catch and correctively dismantle these mutants, as their AI tends to act erratically and refuse to conform to the role of either parent class. However, errors in subsequent generations of replication have resulted in Exploratorium drones becoming more and more error-prone over time, and one of the things that has suffered the most is their quality control protocols, thus allowing these ships to slip into fleets more and more with each passing generation. Due to the chaotic nature of their construction, these are one of the most unpredictable Explorarium hulls, and therefore one of the most dangerous.",,,

As the Bastillion is to the Defender, the Dragontooth is to the Pallisade. And similar to the Bastillion, the upscaling that resulted in this rectangular destroyer was somewhat faulty in execution.

The Silo is a rather humble design even by Exploratorium standards. Originally seeing use as a deployment platform for single-use probes, a military upgrade package sees it retooled as a low-cost missile platform that brings a decent number of missiles for low cost and very little else. An onboard autoforge ensures that the vessel can continue to provide missile support almost indefinitely, but the drone is very fragile and without much in the way of direct defenses.

The Terminal is one of the most egregious examples of the Domain Strategic Council using the Explorarium as a testbad for their bizzare new prototypes. The Terminal comes from the early Expansion-Era, when shields were still new to the battlefield and some decades before modern shield-based defensive doctrine was established. The design consists of a single, gargantuan early-mark shield generator the size of a cruiser mounted onto a series of massively overstressed Rampart engine modules. Doctrinally, the purpose of the design appears to be as a sort of 'umbrella defense', with its' hugely oversized shield bubble allowing unshielded vessels to hide behind it and shoot freely without fear of return fire.

The lack of such ships in modern fleets is evidence enough that this design was considered non-viable.  However the Terminal nonetheless is capable of significantly multiplying the durability of an equipped drone swarm, provided the command AI understands what exactly the unconventional vessel is supposed to do, anyway.",,,

The Battlement, strangely enough, does not appear to actually be an intentionally designed combat drone so much as a perrenial emergent design oversight that Exploratorium computers seemingly deliberately avoid fixing. Analysis of the hull suggests that this capital is somehow only a subsection of an even larger platform, and yet it is capable of independent operation reguardless. From all indicaiton, the Battlement happens when an automated production center attempts to select this 'superdrone' for production, but a shortage of material makes producing the titanic war machine unfeasable for whatever reason, forcing the production AI- most often a Gamma Core- to make 'cuts' to allow the project to continue, cutting away more than 70% of the drone's mass to produce the most cut-down version possible. The AI core will also usually canabalize its' facility and integrate itself into the hull while doing this, creating what is entirely by accident a suprisingly modern command battlecarrier similar in principle to a Explorarium-tech Odyssey.

The Dreadnought-class very obviously resembles the Onslaught-class, and this is no mere coincidence. The Dreadnought began life as a heavily modified  varient of the original pre-upgrade Onslaught, one of many examples of the Domain using the Explorarium (and the endless deniable wars against rebels on the edge of space) as a testbed for experimental technology. The Dreadnought was a complete redesign of the original Onslaught's hull, and was one of the first warships of its' size to fully integrate then-cutting edge technology, developing the core of what would become known as the modern 'Low Tech' design doctrine. A millitary-grade shield generator, a modern flux grid,  a pair of then-experimental Thermal Pulse Cannons that occupy nearly 60% of the volume of the outer hull sectors, and a then-unheard of degree of flexibility in its' armament, these are only the beginning of the countless innovations that the Dreadnought-class pioneered. This lumbering green monster was at one point the Paragon of its' time, and ironically paved the way for many of the upgrades that the Onslaught-class later underwent. In better times, this ship would be in a museum somewhere, that it is instead being sent to slaughter 'rebels' indiscriminately is one of the greatest testaments of how miserable the Persean Sector has become.",,,
DEX_castra,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Most infamous among them are a series of significantly more advanced drones that began to mysteriously appear well after the majority of Domain drone forces were nominally decomissioned. These experimental hulls are seemingly the result of secretive Domain weapons-testing projects that used the old drone fleet as a low-cost test platform. These experimental hulls are significantly more sophisticated and dangerous than their disposable Explorarium bretheren, and should generally be prioritized over lesser drones when decomissioning Explorarium assets.

The Castra bears much in common with its' sister design, the Dreadnought. Both are capital-class experimental combat drones created late in the Explorarium's life cycle that went on to be frontrunners for the capital ships that would eventually become the backbone of the modern 'Low Tech' combat doctrine. Both integrated a variety of advanced technology into their designs that made them wildly unconventional and nigh-unstoppable in the brush wars they were first tested in... and both belong in museams rather than warfleets as a result.

Where the Castra differs from the Dreadnought is in its' exact purpose and implimentation. The Castra was built as a prototype for the experimental 'Project Multitude', a Domain weapons program that would eventually become the Legion-class carrier known today. The Castra's purpose was to test the viability of a capital-scale battlecarrier in asymmetric warfare against frontier rebels, to that end it packs heavy armor, a Damper Field, a variety of heavy armaments and a vast array of missiles, in addition to extensive smallcraft assembly and launch facilities inside its' 'wings'.

It is worth noting that the Castra's initial combat results were actually decidedly negative, with the ship suffering from many of the failings that can still be seen in the modern Legion to this day. Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the project for similar failings that went on to be thrown at its' successor for millenia: insufficient specialization, inflexibility, a generalist design that ensured it would be easily outmatched by specialist units in any given metric, and a per-unit cost that caused even the Explorarium to struggle to deploy the monster.  However, a great deal of money had already been invested in Project Multitude by this time, and despite mediocre results the project forged ahead in the name of profit for the military industrial complex, and eventually the Legion class was birthed nonetheless.",,,
DEX_arsenal_core,SHIP,"One of the legendary Exploratorium factory-ships, this enormous automated vessel is a form of living history. This is in essence a military (or 'berserker') von Neumann probe, as given time and the correct codes this vessel could produce not only a suite of smaller automated ships, but an entire mechanical ecology that could eventually assemble a duplicate vessel, a feat far beyond the manufacturing capabilities of any human faction within the modern Sector. What 'generation' of ships this specimen belongs to is unclear, but its' hull tells a of a long history, burned and battered by its centuries of service to the Domain, and now slumbering quietly in the depths of space until such time as it is needed once more.

Designed as a military counterpart to conventional factory ships such as the typical Survey Mothership or Sporeship, Arsenal Drones have a singular purpose: to establish mobile forward operating bases in the outer reaches of 'rebel' star systems and produce endless hordes of war drones until the rebels are crushed under sheer weight of numbers. In modern times these machines are rarely seen, as automated assembly plants will almost always choose other, more easily produced models over the Arsenal. However, when they are constructed, a newly-activated Arsenal drone will almost always immediately become the network hub for all local Explorarium machines, and the onboard Beta AI core seems to almost invariably conclude that the Sector is in a state of rebellion and must be brought to heel. As a result, the Arsenal has become synonomous with the incessant Derelict seiges that have joined Pirate raids and brush wars as perpetual hazards of life in the Sector. In order to break a seige, it is nessicary to destroy the commanding Arsenal in direct combat.

Thankfully, while the Arsenal's central bay is easily large enough to house a Rampart drone without it touching either wall, it is not capable of manufacturing drones fast enough to launch new hulls of any size larger than a frigate when in combat, however what is effectively a supercarrier capable of launching infinite waves of frigates- crude and obsolete or not- is still a frankly terrifying prospect to imagine.",,,
DEX_castle,SHIP,"This gargantuan automated vessel is the stuff of legends, a monstrous guardian left by a more civilized age to stand an endless vigil over some forgotten treasure. Or at least, that is how the stories go. If entertainment media is to be believed, this type of droneship is almost invincible from head on but is vulnerable to flanking maneuvers, and a maneuverable frigate (or phase ship) can exploit its weak rear-facing defenses to destroy its' exposed core from the rear. Though if the climax of Captain Forever XIV can really be trusted on the matter becomes highly suspect when facing down a station-sized mass of metal burning down on you at top speed while unleashing more ordinance than some entire fleets can bring to bear.

The Castle-class Fortress Drone was designed for a unique role among the Domain Explorarium. Even in the ancient days when the Explorarium was first launched from the fair shores of Sol, it was clear that there would be a need for a guardian that could ward off trespassers- human or otherwise- from high-importance sites, such as military blacksites or dangerous anomalies. It was also evident that, due to the nature of the Exploratorium's mission, this vessel would need to be able to effectively deter trespassers hundreds- or even thousands- of years in the future, after undoubtedly massive amounts of technological advancement. This presented the Domain's designers with one of the nastiest dilemmas that they had ever encountered at that point. How do you future-proof a ship against thousands of years of unknowable future technological development? 

Their solution was simple and quintessentially Domain in thinking: you did it through overwhelming firepower. 

The Castle was a ship designed more than a thousand years ago, the fact that it's armament was virtually peerless in sheer quantity even at the time of the Collapse is a testament to just how far the Domain was willing to go to 'future-proof' it. Able to carry a staggering armament of heavy weapons, the Castle is classified technically as a Macrocapital, a practically unheard of designation. However, despite this the ship is not invincible. Designed in an age where mobility was limited in space warfare and flanking a rare occurrence, the Castle's rear-facing armament is lacking, giving the titan an Achilles's Heel that a savvy commander can perhaps exploit to bring it down without having to sacrifice a fleet to its' waiting maw.",,,
DEX_decimator,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A grim symbol of the Domain's iron-fisted grip on humanity, the Decimator Bombardment Drone is little more than a mobile orbital platform equipped with a monsterously powerful heavy weapon battery intended to send devastating ordinance down a gravity well towards any who might disobey the will of the Domain. Intended as a 'softer' option than a full-scale PK weapon, the Decimator can be retasked from its' normal grisly targeting priorities towards something more tactically useful to support a planetary invasion force. 

Nonetheless, the horrid reputation of this machine ensures that its' use alone is considered tantamount to a warcime. Many planets, after all, bear scars from the deployment of a Decimator platform. Few of those planets still retain a stable population.",,,
DEX_hyperduct,SHIP,"An absolutely gargantuan fuel tanker, Viaducts were exclusively produced as part of the Domain Explorarium's Trans-Arm Pioneer Program hundreds of cycles before all but the most ancient probes had ever entered the sector. These enormous vessels had the sole purpose of carrying immense amounts of fuel to re-supply massive gatehaulers and other colonial superships as a gargantuan tender ship, quite litterally linking themselves into the hulls of the larger vessels like symbiotes in order to share fuel. When the fuel suply of a Viaduct was depleted, they would simply be decoupled and dumped in space like an ancient Earth rocket.  Long trails of these behemoth vessels once marked the paths taken by the Domain's great colonial initiatives to reach the sector, but sicne the collapse many of these historic vessels have been cut apart by shipbreakers and lost to time.

In current times, the only Viaducts that survive are those that through some twist of fate found themselves within Exploratorium directories for one reason or another. It is worth noting that these vessels do not actually exist within the standard Exploratorium blueprint database, but the machines nonetheless seem to understand the inherent use these ancient vessels can still serve. Additionally, some enterprising independent scavengers and mecenary companies have stolen certain vessels of this type through either raw firepower, or cunning network breaches.",,,
DEX_megafreighter,SHIP,"A freighter of absolutely staggering size, the fully automated Evergreen-class was used exclusively for bulk shipments of low-quality goods to prospective colonization sites during second- and third-wave post-Gate colonization. These vessels were never glamarous, except perhaps in the sheer scale of their construction, however their disposable nature has left many to simply fall into disrepair after the Collapse.

The Evergreen class is a design which toed the edge of legality under Domain regulation. Legally, it was an automated freighter, a type of independent automated ship that had a specific exception carved out for it in the Von Braun Resolution on automated ships due on the counsel of major interstellar shipping concerns, however the ship's expansive armament nearly rivals that of a capital-grade warship, and drawing its' base hull from the ancient Von Neumann-class survey mothership, even lacking a shield the robust structure of the ship was more than enough to make it a formidable combatant on the frontier. This, of course, was all by design.",,,
DEX_galaxia,SHIP,"A vessel of mind-boggling scale, the Galaxia-class colony ship was a key part of Domain colonization programs hundreds of cycles ago. Able to easily haul tens of thousands of living souls accross the stars, the Galaxia played a key part in later-wave colonisation missions, intaking countless prospective colonists from the Domain core, and transporting them en-masse on gate-bound one-way journeys to barely-developed colony worlds where they would forge the Domain's future with their own two hands, and surplus equipment graciously provided by Domain industrial partner corporations.

The ship was designed to be highly resistant to mutanies, using innovative technologies such as semi-segrigated internal habitation zones, automatic riot suppression systems, a centrally controlled internal tram system that could be remotely deactivated from the bridge, and most controversially, an autopiloting system that can potentially take over 100% of the vessel's core operations and effectively render the ship 'automated' for the full extent of its' current flight plan. Thus allowing the ship to complete its' flight in the case of a mutiny, and prevent disasterous course changes enacted by foolish would-be mutineers.

Per Domain policy, boarding a Galaxia-class and becoming a colonist was always purely voluntary. However, when given a choice between remaining in the poor, disenfranchised, and even criminal underclasses of the overpopulated megacorporation-operated metroplexes in the Domain core, and a new chance at life in the wild frontiers of the Persean arm, for many there was really no choice at all. And of course, few recruiters or propaganda holos were eager to show these desperate citizens what traveling aboard a Galaxia was actually like.

Packed into dorm-rooms cramped even by the standards of high-density slums, granted precious little privacy, personal space, or room for what belongings they had, and watcehd over by an legion of uncaring and callous enforcers, life aboard many Galaxia-class vessels quickly deteriorated into prison-like conditions, resulting in frequent rioting, violence, and more than a few mutinies that were nonetheless helpless to stop the ship from delivering them to their destination. As a result of this, a great deal of resentment was held towards these ships, not just for the poor conditions the ancestors of many modern Persians endured aboard them, but for their part in 'forcing' early colonists out to the Persean Arm where many lost their lives to the harsh conditions inherent to frontier life. 

As a result, little effort was put into preserving the vessels even before the Collapse. Most Galaxias were scrapped or converted into permenant habitation blocks the size of cities on some planets like Kazeron and Agreus, and of the remainder many were lost or destroyed with the outbreak of chaos and war in the early cycles after the Collapse. Of the ships that remained, most of them were lost to the rapidly forming decivilized outer systems, where they drifed as forgotten derelicts for generations. Due to the ship's unpleasant reputation, the Galaxia was actually striken from official Hegemony codicies around c+75, as the successor state belived that the vessel's unpleasant history was best buried for the sake of public relations. This began a small but concerted effort across Persean culture to strike this vessel from the history books, relegating it to purely apycryphal status and forgotten derelicts at the edge of space. Precious few have any reason to drag this forgotten dinosaur back into the present, as the modern Sector simply has little need for moving populations numbered in the tens of thousands all at once.",,,
DEX_redstone,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Redstone, in its' original Type I configuration, is an ancient form of first-wave survey vessel. Type I Redstones would be deployed to chart newly discovered systems, using the immense delta-V provided by their Orion Drive systems to map out a new system's graivty wells before the rest of the fleet would even leave hyperspace- a time consuming, but nessicary task in order to plot optimal flight paths through star systems. During the majority of a Redstone I's operating time, the vessel would actually enter a hybernation state, placing all of its' systems into a low-power mode in between manuver nodes, where the ship would suddenly re-activate to fire its' orion drive, alter its' trajectory to the desired path, and then return to hybernation to wait for the next node. This mode of travel inherently demanded that the Redstone be designed with extensive redundancies in case of micrometiorite impacts. Additionally, like all Explorarium survey ships, the Redstone I used onboard micro-manufactories to produce disposable survey-impactor drones and nav-beacons.

All of these things combined to make the Redstone an ideal platform for conversion into a combat vessel when the Explorarium became militarized. Thus, the Redstone II varient exchanges the original survey equipment for a wide array of ballistic and missile weapons, while the ship's heavily redundant systems and potential for extreme burst movement using its' Orion Drive make it a dangerous combatant.",,,
DEX_luddstone,SHIP,"A heavily modified ancient exploration drone, the Penitent combines a deadly forward missile battery and powerful engines to serve as an extremely low-tech, but highly mobile and agressive battlecruiser. In many ways it paralells the Retribution employed by the Luddic Church, though some would argue that this monstrosity is even more effective in its' preferred role.

All but the most radical of Luddic sects absolutely abhor artificial intelligence in all forms, considering it the 'pure spawn' of Moloch, and the Domain's extensive use of 'sinful thinking machines' to be the ultimate expression of the fallen empire's abhorrent departure from God's Golden Path, one that superceeds terraforming, the Gate network, Phase technology and even the ruthlessly exploitive technocratic underpinnings of Domain governance itself. It seems utterly bizzare, then, to see what is very clearly a heavily modified Redstone-class vanguard drone, constructed long ago by the Explorarium, serving in a fleet belonging to the fanatics of the Luddic Path. However, a combination of desperation, fanaticism, and absolute adherence to the idea of a never-ending holy war waged for humanity's collective soul against the forces of Moloch gives the Luddic Path a paradoxically pragmatic approach to doctrine. In short, while advanced technology is sinful, and artificial intelligence is evil, the Redstone-class is even in its' default configuration highly adept at the forms of warfare that the Path most excels in, and is highly effective while forgoing advanced technology to a level that even the most devout of Pather technicians can't manage. Thus it leads some to question, what if instead of simply destroying the sinful vessel, it was in some way... brought into line with the Path, perhaps as a form of Penance?

The Garrison-class Heavy Cruiser is an intimidating sight among Explorarium forces. Designed as a 'pocket flagship', this large cruiser carries advanced processors and communications arrays, and an extensive internal autofactory. In combat it serves as a cruiser-carrier to be reckoned with, however it is much more dangerous outside of combat, where its' ""sleek"" and relatively light footprint compared to other Explorarium command drones makes it a common choice for more lightweight directories, such as those assigned to escort Motherships or guard low-security installations.",,,

The Fort-class Heavy Command Drone is something of a rare and intimidating sight among Explorarium fleets. Equipped with fighter bays, missiles and a variety of heavy weapons, this behemoth capital was originally designed as a mobile command hub from which an Exploratorium AI could effectively oversee the operation of an entire Directory with minimal lag time, effectively making these drones into 'Flag Ships' for the Explorarium's fleets.

DEX_stockpile_c,SHIP,"Though technically illegal, the hijacking of Exploratorium drones is quite common in the sector. While the machines may be woefully outdated and not made for human habitation, when the question is between having a ship and not having one, it is an easy choice to make. These vessels usually undergo the barest of refits to make their machinery more easily maintained with conventional methods and technically legal to dock in most ports- thus the non-essiential bridge and crew stations added out of little more than obligation.

Suprisingly coveted for something so ugly, the Stockpile is a common black market item in independent volumes. Its' appeal is very simple: it is a fully automated transport ship capable of carrying virtually any cargo, it is relatively fast, impressively fuel-efficient, and features a modular design similar to the Rampart, allowing for an ease of repair and mantinence that makes contemporary freighters look like Hyperions. As such, these ships are very commonly 'salvaged' by independent traders in dire need of a way to cut down on costs, and even sometimes find their way into the hands of actual militaries as support vessels. 

There is no standard template for the exact modifications performed on a 'Civilian' Stockpile drone, but the most common variation sees the port outer storage module replaced with a section of a Tarsus (usually the same section removed to create a Condor), while a mantinence bay on the starboard side is cut open to serve as an improvised hangar. These efforts are really little more than a token affair done to give plausible deniability, as the ship is still woefully underarmed in combat, and best left to the back line.",,,
DEX_larder_c,SHIP,"Legally considered to be an 'advanced remote-operated drone' due to a complex political situation surrounding its' use, this simplistic tanker drone is considered legal to purchase under Hegemony law, though with some minor credential requirements. It's use is generally held in contempt by Luddic sects as proof of the Hegemony being willing to 'serve Moloch for convenience', but the taboo is not great enough for the Church to outright ban the many independent traders who make use of the drone for its' tight logistic footprint and inexpensive manufacturing cost.

The Larder is an incredibly simple machine with a suprisingly interesting history. Little more than an automated fuel tanker, this drone is so lowly that it does not even have the capacity to be operated by an AI Core under normal circumstances due to its' onboard computer core being both too cramped and lacking the required cooling equipment. This is important because the Larder is also a very, very cheap fuel tanker that is easy to maintain and does not require any miserable short straw-drawing crewmen to live aboard it. This makes it incredibly appealing in the current state of the sector, moreso even than other Explorarium utility drones. But as an automated ship, it was banned like all the rest.

That is, until C+166 saw a number of comissioned traders within the Hegemony band together in a political coalition to see this little ship granted an exception to the automation ban. Or more accurately, to have its' legal status as an automated ship revoked entirely. The Larder, so the coalition argued, was too simple to be considered fully automated. While direct control was unessicary in its' day to day operation, the simpleminded computer core of the ship was incapable of the long-term decision making that would classify it as truly capable of operation without human intervention. As such, the Larder was in reality little more than a large, fuel-hauling version of a standard mining drone, something legal even in Luddic space.

This claim was of course hotly contested, but a simple bit of Realpolitick worked in the coalition's favor: The Larder is quite litterally cheaper to build and maintain than some fightercraft, and the Hegemony navy stood to gain quite the logistical advantage by simplifying something as universal as fuel transport. As such, after three years of hotly-debated legal disputes, the Hegemony Supreme Court legally ruled the Larder to be classifed not as an automated ship, but as an 'assisted teleoperated drone', and therefore completely legal.

The Larder has since been re-adopted by many groups across the sector for its' slight undercutting of the Dram in operaitonal costs, though it is notably still considered to be a distasteful display of technological barbarity by many Luddic sects, and traders travelling to Gilead with a Larder in tow will often attach a dummy bridge to the drone in the hopes of masking their sinful nature, to middling success.",,,

The Silo is a particularly prized target for pirate Explorarium rustling, as the little cruiser's potent missile capacity allows it to punch well above its' weight. However, the compact design makes it decidedly difficult to fit the additional systems pirates typically add to hijacked drones, forcing 'creative' bypass methods to be used. The bulbous form of an aftermarket shield generator can typically be seen sprouting from the ship's processing module, alongside the outrigged hab module where the live-in technicians who keep the drone functioning reside, while the opposite side of the ship will typically mount a very awkwardly placed ballistic turret that typically has its' range severely limited by a slipshod placement that renders it incapable of turning forwards without colliding with the missile loading system.",,,

While the haphazard external attachments to the drone greatly improve its' secondary armament, they also introduce a weakness. In order to reduce reliance on rare, specialized mantinence tools, an outrigged command pod- often a Hound cabin- is often stuck to the drone's outer hull in order to provide semi-permenant residence to a small team of dedicated specialists that manages the drone's operations.

DEX_guardsman,SHIP,"A humanoid variable-assault strikecraft, this 100-ton robot is equally effective in space, and as a combatant in planetary assaults. Its' heavy railgun packs a punch, and its' slow speed hides suprising agility. Due to its' more humanoid apparence, this mech is often treated as a 'poster child' for the Explorarium, as it is much more personable than a Berserker or Warden.",,,

DEX_nomad_drone,SHIP,"This almost organic-looking wardrone seems to have been designed entirely independently by the Nomad AI. It carries what appears to be a downscaled autopulse laser, though how the AI managed to devise such a thing remains unclear.",,,
DEX_thunderstrike,SHIP,"Practically little more than a spaceborne chaingun with underslung missile pods, the Thunderstrike has a hellish reputation as a close-in support fighter... despite its' rather slow speed, 'tough' (yet nowhere near tough enough) armor and rather close-in preferred combat range tending to make it into an easy target. Still, no fighter with a gun that large should ever be taken lightly.",,,
DEX_trojan,SHIP,"An ancient form of assault dropship, this vehicle is primarily intended as a form of troop-lander for robotic ground troops, thus its' heavy focus on survivability. However, the armiment meant to support ground troops in practice serves just as well supporting other strikecraft in a space combat role.",,,

DEX_legionary,SHIP,"A heavier fighter striking a solid midpoint between the Spartan and frigate-sized Warden, the Legionary equips larger and faster-firing autocannons that are markedly effective against shields in large numbers, as well as a crude ammo-feed accelerator that can temporarily bolster their firing rate, making a large swarm of these drones the worst nightmare of any ship dependent on shields for defense, and ensuring that CWIS guns everywhere earn their keep.",,,
DEX_spartan,SHIP,"An incredibly basic and diminutive combat drone, the Spartan is one of the lowliest forms of the Explorarium war machine. Coming in massive numbers as almost a matter of course, these fighters are notable for their archaic autocannons being abnormally effective against shielded targets for their size due to using archaic solid-core tungsten penetrators as standard munitions. In swarms, this can quickly overwhelm shielded targets, and makes eliminating these drones before they become too numerous to handle a key priority in any engagement against the Explorarium.",,,
DEX_m3payload,SHIP,"This humble cargo drone has served the Exploratorium since its' original launch, but usually in far more peaceful roles than this. What exactly prompted the development of an 'ordinance transport' template for this vehicle is unknown, but despite its' incredibly crude design, the high ordinance capacity these cargo haulers can bring to bear have made them the bane of many an unfortunate would-be scavenger.",,,
DEX_skystar,SHIP,"Effectively a flying flak battery designed for compatability with LPC systems, it is unclear if this turret masurading as a fighter was actually some forgotten Domain prototype, or something designed by some crude machine intelligence within the Explorarium. Either way, in its' crude simplicity it is highly effective at swatting other strikecraft.",,,

DEX_unholy,SHIP,"For many decades the Lunar-class battlestar has been a boogeyman seemingly conjured from the imagination of spacers with far too much to drink, attempting to one-up tales of 'red planets', 'giant plasma shooting space bugs', or 'evil triangles that shoot lightning'. Unfortunately, it seems that this particular tale had more fact to it than most would hope.

The uncanny internals of this vessel bear all the hallmarks of an AI-generated design. Illogical tangles of conduit. maze-like internal sections maintained only by tiny service robots, standard components twisted into bizzare and incomprehensible shapes in persuit of some ineffable idea of better performance. It is clear enough that this design was made independently by Tri-Tachyon's AI admirals, a feat that while not unheard of, is intensely concerning upon further analysis of the ship's hull.

Deep within the ship's processing core, the standard mounting for an AI Core bears distinct signs of modification, seemingly having been retooled to interface with a particular line of advanced cybernetics produced by Tri-Tachyon with the intent of allowing a single human pilot to control an entire starship, merging their nervous system with the vessel to break down the barrier between man and machine completely. What possible purpose the entirely automated TTDS could have for integrating this incredibly complex technology into their self-designed hulls is currently unknown, but there is no potential answer that doesn't seem liable to drive any sane man to repent their sins against Ludd.",,,
DEX_rastral,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

Glitzy, glamorous and ruinously expensive, the Celestial-class Fleet Carrier was at one point loathed for being emblimatic of the excesses that went into research and development by Tri-Tachyon's Automated Securities division. Despite automation typically being primarily an efficiency and cost-cutting measure, this vastly over-spec cousin of the Astral is neither efficient nor cheap. What it is, however, is horrifically effective as a fleet anchor for Tri-Tachyon's automated warfleets. Thus, the beginning of the First AI War ushered in an entirely new kind of loathing for the Celestial class.",,,
DEX_poltergeist,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Ghost stands as the only phase vessel offered among Tri-Tachyon's infamous Automated Securities product line. To those unversed in the details of AI operation, this might seem odd considering the corporation's obsession with producing only the most cutting-edge and ruinously expensive machines for this range, of which Phase Ships are a perennial denizen in most other schools thanks to their horrifically delicate machinery. However the reality is that it is a miracle this vessel was even produced at all, despite the long-standing desire for such a vessel among the Tri-Tachyon board. 

Artificial Intelligence and Phase Space are two fields of research that are notoriously difficult to crossbreed without disasterous results, and even Tri-Tachyon's infinitely bloated research and development budget failed at creating a combat AI that could withstand the rigors of phase space for centuries. This design was only finalized in the final days of the Domain, with some suggesting that the creation of the particularly erratic specialized AI that operates it may have some link to the Collapse itself. Of course, these are only fringe theories, and in operation the Ghost is perfectly functional, if prone to performing unpleasant 'pranks' on its' handlers.",,,

derelict,FACTION,"The Domain Explorarium was a historical organization responsible for overseeing the early stages of exploration and colonization on the very outermost regions of Domain space. Controversially, this was done using self-replicating multifunction drone ships that would be considered highly illegal were they deployed by anyone other than the Domain itself, or were they deployed anywhere within officially incorporated volumes. The fallout of this was the creation of the much more familiar Explorarium Derelicts: a swarm of highly obsolete but extremely tenacious green droneships that continuously menace the Sector according to some long-lost protocol.

The Collapse changed little for the Derelicts, as the machines' contact with the Domain was already fleeting and sporadic. These machines are arguably the most well-adapted and successful of the Domain's myriad offspring. Unfortunately, the Derelicts don't really understand the nature of the post-collapse world they exist in and continue to operate off the ancient mandate designating the entire Persean Arm as a 'frontier' zone, and designate any within without appropriate Domain-cleared identification and charter documents as 'rebels' who must be shown the Domain's wrath. From a human perspective this causes the machines to appear erratic and unpredictable, but this assumes a level of agency the Explorarium does not have. 

Most major powers consider civilian fleets approaching these drones to be illegal for public safety reasons, though these laws are rarely enforcable. It is common to send military fleets decomission any significant groupings of active Explorarium drones, but the current state fo the Sector makes devoting military assets to such a task impractical, causing many factions to ironically resort to issuing technically-illegal bounties on these machines to private navies that are not legally allowed to engage them. Filling out such bounties is a highly lucrative career path, as these ancient warfleets will likely continue to play a role in the Sector's history until every human within has been ground to dust, and likely for many thousands of years afterwards.",,,
