fed_burstlaser1,WEAPON,"A plasma pulse repeater offering best-in-class burst potential, disruptive polarity charge, all at a reasonable mounting cost. Throughput suffers massively once capacitors are exhausted.

Often reputed as the wealthy merchant-marine's ""self-defense weapon of choice"", the Light Pulser is economical and potent versus the shoddy armor plating of pirate raiders. Solely owning the design and manufacturing rights at the start of the Collapse, Gygas Industries profited millions of centi-credits as the sector's security deteriorated.

Small enough to be mounted on ground installations, the plasmatic nature of the Light Pulser's projectile can survive in many atmospheric mediums. When not fighting starships, this weapon is a brutal anti-vehicle and bombardment platform - albeit at the cost of an installation's powergrid.",General,,
fed_burstlaser2,WEAPON,"A capacitor-fed, burst-operated weapon with surprising efficiency against armored targets, though systemic modifications are required to prolong maximum output.

Developed by Gygas Industries on Cessitoc's northern pole, the Pulser series often went under civilian modifications to scale back its power requirements. This was often done to ease the mounting costs of a proper weapon, which was a middle ground between crews demanding anti-pirate measures and the margins to be made with expanded cargo hold mods. Gygas declared all postmarket powerplant alterations ""actionably illegal"" shortly after catching wind of the trend, fearing the power-starved variants would ruin the image of the Pulser brand.

Gygas Industries still failed to secure Pulser production contracts outside of the Star Federation Navy. Neither megacorp nor the Domain Naval Procurement agency found the weapon to be worth the steep purchase cost, especially when existing high-tech ships were rare.",General,,
fed_burstlaser3,WEAPON,"A high-performance variant of plasma pulser with impressive volley damage and reasonable armor efficiency. A good generalist weapon, if not restrained by capacitor size.

The largest pulse weapon developed by Gygas Industries, and more akin to a plasma mortar because of its ability to punch through armor. The Ultraheavy Pulser never saw great production throughout the sector due to its complexity and draconian manufacturing licensing, for the latter was never removed - even after it failed to qualify for Domain procurement. Since the Star Federation was the only faction in close proximity to Gygas's polar complex, they were able to sieze the entire complex of the disintegrating megacorporation. The holonet rumors that Scaria's defense drone relic came from within the vaults of Gygas, perhaps with several dreaded planet killer devices.

The UH-Pulser is said by some to be the worst of both worlds. Lacking the obliteration of the arcane Plasma Cannons, the sharp kick of a fully powered Autopulse, and especially the devastating wash of the Tacyhon Lance. Still, a few examples have seen these large cannons mounted on planetary installations, as they can provide anti-ship fire in atmospheric conditions. A quick burst from synchronized batteries dries up evasion vectors quickly, and the cohesive pulse-plasma is effective at incredible distances.",General,,
fed_flak1,WEAPON,"A light cannon that fires a small spread of multipurpose projectiles. While individually weak and therefore less effective against armor, the raw damage can overwhelm lighter shield generators.

The specially-designed projectiles of Scrapshot weapons collapse inwards on themselves on impact, fusing their cores in a millionth of a second. The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components. Though its ability to punish shield generators is appreciated, its weak effect on hull has earned it the moniker ""sparkleshot"" among its gun crews.",Close Support,,
fed_flak2,WEAPON,"A medium cannon that fires a large spread of multipurpose projectiles. While individually weak and therefore less effective against armor, the raw damage is able to overwhelm shield generators. The large amount of shrapnel can also disrupt sensitive components.

The specially-designed projectiles of Scrapshot weapons collapse inwards on themselves on impact, fusing their cores in a millionth of a second. The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components. Though it doesn't blast actual heaps of scrap as its name implies, the impactors are bent in strange ways by the explosions within them.

The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components. A pre-Domain invasion concept, this weapon was merely improved and scaled for Federation use with the assistance of the ENGICore AI network. It saw little usefulness against ensuing Domain drone swarms, whose sturdy and unshielded hulls could easily absorb the stray fragments. Said drones also ensured the factories and labs responsible for improving Scrapshots were razed to the ground.",Close Support,,

The collection of consciousnesses within ENGICore concluded Federation technological advances would be unable to produce small beam weapons with cost-effective stopping power. Their solution yielded a miniaturized device firing a pulse of poorly understood particles, seemingly existing between hyperspace and realspace for an incredibly short period.

fed_artbeam,WEAPON,"A ship-sized beam built into the core of the Osprey-class cruiser. Capable of obliterating unshielded targets and initiating EMP cascades through shields. A lengthy shutdown delay ensures local p-space does not catastrophically rupture from sustained usage.

Built around a vast array of crystalline mediums, the fusion of these independent nodes produces incomprehensibly energetic anomalies on downrange targets. Seemingly scaling with mass displacement, the powerful flow of virtual particles blasts through all but the hardiest of armor and hull. The fervent cascade of energy through the crystals is so great that field dampers are required to stop energy rifts from appearing inside the array mechanisms. ",Close Support,,

fed_beam_halberd,WEAPON,"A rare and powerful strike beam, the bulky accelerator assembly of the Halberd beam allows it to spall through strained shields. Incredibly effective despite its limited range and taxing power draw.

Somewhat under-engineered, the Halberd compresses a wide emission stream into a narrow lance using strange hypercooled field emitters in its prongs. As the base emitter fires longer, virtual particle pressure increases at the chokepoint, somehow self-annihilating and reforming into a more powerful directed energy stream. This configuration requires hypercooling mechanisms that push the edge of cryogenic applications and create a huge maintenance overhead, but produce an uncannily powerful beam.

Undoubtedly AI-developed, this highly unusual weapon represents the last iterations of Star Federation pre-Collapse technology. Only surpassed by the Glaive (which is a different weapon mechanism entirely), it is nearly just as rare.",Strike,,
fed_beam_glaive,WEAPON,"Capable of obliterating entire ships with a single burst, the Glaive is a formidable beam cannon known for its devastating power. A low base range is offset its ability to pierce the shields of flux-stressed shields and obliterate fighters.

An extremely advanced weapon, the Glaive uses a collection of bizarre crystalline virtual particle emitters to saturate the orbit of a micro-singularity inside the weapon. By slowly collapsing the singularity, the explosive discharge of escaping accretion can be focused through its signature front-mounted aperture. It is a feat only possible with double the amount of containment field emitters and a-grav generators found on most Mastery-era frigates.

Star Federation officials are keen to keep this weapon exclusively in the hands of Federation armories, for its mere silhouette serves as an incredible source of recruiting material or morale boost for crews.

Controversial in nature due to their autonomus capacity, the crude combat intelligence of the Omnidrone has been tethered to the fielding ship's datastream. While this avoids the scrutiny of AI regulators, the Delta-class AI removal has severely restricted the range. Despite this mitigation, Omnidrones continue to be mounted on Federation hulls to help obliterate stray frigates and finish off crippled cruisers.",,,
fed_talos,SHIP,"The Brane-class is a chip-hacked variant of a hunter-killer drone, altered by inclusion of a habitation module replacing its theoretical robotic inhabitant. The unusually sparse weapons array is substantiated by a feed-acceleration mechanism and stronger shield generator, both made possible by a lack of human-traversible comparments.  A minor point defense array supplements its staying power, much to the irritation of its cramped crew.

In the early days of their settling of the Persean arm, the Star Federation employed heavy use of fully automated Brane droneships to discourage upstarting piracy. Such AI vessels were patient and tenacious hunters, capable of waiting nearly for weeks in anticipation of a target. Originally deployed by hyperspace-capable drone tenders, the drones have since been retrofitted with all of the necessary equipment for crew and hyperspace space travel. Some patrol commanders even let the crew board a more hospitable vessel during extended periods of downtime.",,,
fed_byte,SHIP,"The Byte is a chip-hacked autodrone with a habitation and command module instead of an AI core housing. Such a tiny ship achieves awesome firepower because it dedicates less volume to human life support and facilities.  This also means it is equally as fragile, lacking many non-critical systems that could potentially absorb a stray shot.

In the early days of their settling of the Persean arm, the Star Federation employed heavy use of fully automated Byte droneships to discourage budding piracy. Such AI vessels were patient and tenacious hunters, capable of waiting nearly for weeks in anticipation of a target. Originally deployed by hyperspace-capable drone tenders, the drones have since been retrofitted with all of the necessary equipment for crew and hyperspace space travel. Uncomfortable, at best.",,,
fed_tern,SHIP,"A large and well-armed line-frigate with a comfortable interior to distract its crew from a lack of modular point-defense mounts. Whether a Bell is outfitted for fleet support or frigate hunting, its limited weapon count demands specialization that befits its intended role. Some private buyers find its lack of flexibility disturbing, but the Star Federation is infamous for issuing these ships to just about every fleet.

The Bell is an iconic ship that holds a special place in the history of the Federation. As one of the first vessels to be designed by the Federation naval architects, it served as a testbed for early experiments in technology that deviated from Domain standards. Over the years, it underwent several modernization efforts, each adding progressively more advanced features while still retaining its iconic two-nacelle design. Although it was originally slated for a final, ultra-high-tech upgrade, the Federation High Command eventually redirected the refit funding to focus on the production of ever-larger capital ships.

Contrary to spacer jokes old, this generation of the Bell has very adequate fuel tanks; only the most careless of commanding officers should find themselves begging passing starfarers for fuel.",,,
fed_lightdestroyer,SHIP,"The Invader is an adrenaline-inducing assignment for junior officers with excellent speed and appreciable weapon hardpoints. More wary captains and keen opponents will observe the lack of point defense and thin hull plating, not to mention uncountable situations unsolvable by its doctrine of outright aggression. 

In spite of the critics, the statistical kill count on ""piratical"" craft far exceeds that of other Federation destroyers. Its modest success means the Invader has remained roughly similar over the epochs; it is little more than a weapon hardpoints welded to a high-spec reactor, plasma-compressor engines surrounded by a curving thermal disspator shell, and a somewhat servicable habitation spar on the front of it all. 

Being the most predominant of the Star Federation's deep-space hunter craft, the Invader's reputation is tarnished by numerous incidents regarding the behavior of its captaincy. Perhaps given an intoxicating sense of independence as they left Federation space to pursue criminals, or even driven to desparation for supplies, these rogue officers purportedly acted no better than the pirates they pursued. Rumor has it these bad apples were planted by precautionary Domain planners seeking to slow the Federation's growth, but there are very few theories one cannot find on the TriNet. ",,,
fed_cormorant,SHIP,"An overgunned ship with a truly fearsome strike and support potential, the Daptrius is known for its high-energy superchargers and numerous missile hardpoints. Ballistic-preferring tacticians and commanders in the Federation are weary of it more than most high-tech Federation designs; a short-range energy destroyer with no mobilty systems makes for an easy target. Conversely, more audacious captain can appreciate the Datptrius's unlockable potential through safety overrides. 

Even discounting its odd combat profile, the Daptrius statistically performs well with the slower pace of Federation fleet action. Many in administration roles believe it to excellent introduction to energy systems for new crews, further reforcing its positive image among Federation leadership. Indeed statistics reveal over 63% of Class M personnel certified for High Energy Manipulation and Maintenance certifications have logged significant time aboard a Daptrius.

Initially planned as a replacement for the old Brava gun-barge, the ambitious Federation/Tri-Tachyon subsidiary project was 'completed' just tens of cycles before the Collapse. Both entities desired ubiquitous destroyer with low production and maintenance overheads, with the decision made to let the Federation handle general construction and TT provide systems expertise and production capital. When the finished prototype failed to meet TT's high expectations for speed and defense, it was no surprise that Tri-Tachyon's subsidiary refused to provide funding for the full production run. Perhaps attempting to save credibility, or possibly attempting to rebuff the megacorporation for its rejection, the Federation decided to allocate funds for double the original hull quota. ",,,
fed_cormorant_old,SHIP,"A stocky vessel designed to pose a threat to cruisers, the Cormorant is bristling with missiles and gun batteries. This older model destroyer follows a practical and simplistic doctrine: Missiles are limited, but so are enemy reinforcements. Should it ever expend all of its missiles, the lack of follow-through or initiation may leave it somewhat passive for a heavy destroyer, thus earning its designation as a ""bomber"" destroyer.  

With the Cormorant's age comes a ruggedness and simplicity in many areas, including habitation facilities. Its crew sometimes compare it to the grueling interiors of early Old Earth submersible vessels, or at least whatever concerning claims pre-Holovid media is able to make of them. Still, most veterans know only the greenest spacers are disturbed by rest-shifts between warhead racks and caustic propellant silos.",,,
fed_rigger,SHIP,"The Centa is a light carrier with a slightly larger fighter complement and respectable missile capacity. A frontier-friendly design as well, the generous cargo and comfortable crew quarters make it a favorite among explorers and scavengers. Special accommodations must be made to allow it to participate in survey operations, but generous technical specifications will accept lots of ""creativity"".

Early Federation colonies couldn't always provide maintenance and repair depots for starships, but most operated the Centa-class repair rigger--commissioned from a Mybae-Gogol subsidiary--which was able to produce hull-mending drones using specialized nanoforge. The Centa variant seen in the current cycles is a refitted as a carrier with a standard-pattern LPC nanoforge, as the repair drones were more about convenience than efficency.

Other Centa models include salvage, construction, and even a highly-illegal drone maintenance craft. The lattermost were presumably destroyed after the signing of 2nd AI war treaty, where Federation decommissioning protocol suggested they be dumped into an undisclosed gas giant.

",,,
fed_rigger_firesupport,SHIP,"The Brava sports an empowered heavy weapon emplacement at the cost of its auxiliary weapon compliment. Relying largely on range, the Brava can be a rather easy target for both larger and smaller opponents. Still, the old guard in the Star Federation insist the best defense is a punishing offense. The low cost of the Brava means it is an easy way to validate that sentiment, but care must be taken given its lack of point defense measures.

Developed shortly after the Bell to gain a firepower advantage over heavily armored combat freighters, this relatively old design was particularly unpopular with crews until the crew module was extended with extra amenities. Some Brava models even featured a drone bay on the backside of the body module, but most were phased out when the new Centa-class dedicated carrier proved to be more efficient.

Little more than a platform made to deliver capital-grade firepower, the Brava-class found surprising success in internal policing deployments. Leaving escorting and chasing to smaller skiffs and corvettes, the mere sight of the Brava's large guns is attractive to many port authorities. These ""berth-sitter"" Bravas largely spend their time as a pseudo honor-guard; a career defined by drifting along civilian traffic coordiors, flaunting the discipline required to maintain clean hull panelling, and lending crew to help with inspection details.",,,
fed_stealth,SHIP,"One of the few Star Federation ships to sport phase technology, the Nesasio is terrifyingly overarmed for a phasecraft. While most Domain phasecraft rely on unique capabilities to inflict damage, the Nesasio simply uses powerful microburst engines to ensure the totality of its payload is delivered. Lacking the hull and armor to engage enemies head on, this sleek vessel typically preys on any straying, vulnerable, or even unassuming targets. A lack of dedicated point defense solutions can leave it surprisingly vulnerable to fightercraft and missile threats.

The Nesasio-class certainly bears little resemblance to most Tri-Tachyon phase designs, especially how its neutrino emissions are interpreted as an odd ""blue"" color. Various prototype phase rigs--used exlusively by academics for research--often express unique color ""emissions"" too, but usually with impractical levels of coil instability. This is not true of the Nesasio and its relatively standard field grade, which is just as peculiar as the Star Federation intelligence operatives who often serve as the Nesasio's commanding officer.

Few individuals claim to know the origin of this utterly strange vessel, much less how it came to be in the Star Federation's hands. Those who do whisper of dark labs in the interstellar void-shores of the Persean arm and gifts from ""Those Who Wait On The Other Side"". Such topics can also be found in TriVid starship-operas or obscure Holonet conspiracy videos.
",,,
fed_kestral,SHIP,"The signature ""tough little ship"" of the Star Federation, the Kestrel's armored prow compensates for the ship's lighter weapon array and generally slow speed. This armor module will absorb plenty of kinetic rounds, insulate the hull from ionic damage, and even save the ship from a fatal volley of Harpoon missiles. While the Kestrel may seem weak after the armor detatches from incurred damage, its limited protection means allies are more important than the strength of an individual ship. In that sense, the Kestrel represents a moral which the Star Federation could have better practiced during the chaos of the Collapse.

A very early adopter of the ""cruiser school"" doctine popular in the Domain, the Kestrel was also the largest ship early Federation industries could produce. Lacking Domain-restricted implements and facilities for capital starships, the Kestrel's ""pride-of-the-fleet"" status is reflected by the presence thoughtful ergonomics and high-quality crew accomodiations. Later variants becoming the testbed for novel technologies such as missile-micro replication also affirmed its place as the unofficial Federation mascot; Model sales and holo-games featuring the Kestrel are among the biggest incomes for the Federation's civilian relations and propaganda divisions.

Star Federation legend (or propaganda) tells of a lone Kestrel defeating a defected Rebellion-class battleship. Though highly unlikely given the extreme threat posed by a Rebellion-class, simulations indicate it may have been possible with the help of extreme modifications. ",,,
fed_raptor,SHIP,"The Jager's ubiquitous missiles capacity is impressive for a mid-tier line cruiser even disregarding the high-power targeting radar and predictive computer arrays. In short bursts, this cruiser can send coordinated missile strikes and opportunistic ballistic barrages from great ranges, which is important given how long sub-par defenses last. Ideal in line fleets given their need for protection, but otherwise surprisingly poor line vessels themselves.

Even though it is not the most durable, elegant, or even cheapest of vessels, the Jager's chief value is all in the economics. With the Federation preferring Jager variants that focus on close-support missiles and ballistics, the amount of credits spent repairing the ship hardware and paying out crew death policies is quite low. Many of its captains also tend to reflect this sentiment with their cautious personalities, even if their ship cultures have occasionally caused hotter-headed subordinates to serve Dereliction of Duty and Gross Negligence accusations.

Essentially a successful design in spite of its tumultuous development program, the Jager was intended to create an effective fleet support ship. The cost of meeting this goal produced an ungainly profile laden with missile bunkers, printing complexes, and claustrophobic access tunnels. While this makes it a somewhat unpleasant ship for its crew and commanders, the signature of its bulky hull is a comfort to other Federation fleets in the Persean sector.",,,
fed_osprey,SHIP,"The Osprey is almost a literal glass cannon, seemingly more optical assemblies than bulkheads. Even though it has lower range than most artillery cruisers, the long-ranged ""Artillery Beam"" it unleashes will cripple enemies through their shields. Lacking a sufficient engineering budget for the ship system and defense turrets, the Osprey is the only Star Federation cruiser to utilize a simple defensive flak screen.

The trope of the young enlistee generally depicts the fearless, eager, and unwary: they often have nothing to lose. Such a spacer would prefer the glory of ships that use both speed and firepower to seize the day. This would mean they are seldom found on an Osprey, where they would quickly grow tired of its long maintenance shifts and cautious combat disposition. While only partially true, the Osprey certainly attracts crews in search of the slower and safer pace of a ""fleet"" ship. The Star Federation has little trouble filling berths with enlistees who have loved ones beyond their service, but this does mean Osprey losses often have devastating consequences for those at home.

Generally speaking, the Federation is known for an anti-war disposition and non-aggression policy - but an icon of war like the Osprey betrays how thin that facade can be. The extreme refinement of the Osprey suggests a greater level of AI co-development commonly later Star Federation hulls, with the Artillery Beam being an especially curious example. The Persean sector particle physics institutions--while magnitudes worse compared to those found in the time of the Domain--can deduce it involves the formation of anti-tachyons which experience time backwards in our universe. This stream appears to penetrate shields because the anti-tachyons have already formed inside of target, where they will encounter the positive-tachyon stream produced by a secondary beam assembly, annihilating themselves and most of the target in the process.

fed_flagship,SHIP,"The Union-class battlecarrier is a versatile vessel capable of relief campaigns, scientific surveys, and deep-space expeditions. In combat, the secondary shield, flexible weapon mounts, and respectable fighter complement give it an equally well-rounded presence. The Union played a critical role in the Federation's struggle for independence when the Domain began open conflict, becoming a vital tool for both military operations and relief efforts. Its Federation crews still view their strange-looking ship as a beacon of hope and a symbol of their resilience in the grim darkness of the Persean wastes.

While the Union represents the pinnacle of the Star Federation's native industrial capacity, its sophistication the result of a co-development with an unscrupulous subsidiary of the ""Ko Combine"" megacorporation. The prototype's promised performance was able attract the attention of watchful Domain agents, though it was more likely valued as evidence of the megacorporation's solicitation of seditious worlds. The day after the prototype's completion, a small Domain taskforce utilized a dirty Ko Combine executive to smuggle off the sole prototype and destroy the covert shipbuilding facility with a hyperdrive overload. The Federation council remained undaunted and approved the construction of new capital-class production facilities at great expense, demonstrating their eagerness to replace the aging Resolute-class battleships and disregard for the Domain's interference.

Richly integrated with late Domain technology, the both the Union and Accordant were a massive step forward in shipbuilding expertise. Predating sleeker Accordant-class battlecruiser by just a cycle, the Union-class battlecarrier is distinguished by its round saucer section and wider set engine nacelles.  This knowledge would be quickly applied to the still-in-development Rebellion-class battleship, though the ensuing production of said battleships would choke out nanoforge bandwidth from both Accordant and Union alike.
",,,
fed_flagship_assault,SHIP,"A transitionary mid-to-high-tech battlecruiser, the Accordant's abundance of energy weapons and missiles give it a remarkable capacity for rapid assaults. Largely designed to counter cruiser-school doctrine, the generalist nature of its energy weapons tends to perform poorly against other capital ships without careful preparation. Keen opponents would also note the ship's relative fragility and distinct lack of retro-thrusters.

The Accordant the clenched fist to the Union's open palm, unafraid of waging war with its heavy flak battery and missile replicator systems. Though there is debate whether any high-tech ship designs could be made without the assistance of AI cores, the Accordant is still seen as the first proper capital ship native to the Star Federation. Its reputation is unfortunately tarnished by a terrible early service record; One particular pre-Collapse battle with hostile Domain forces saw several Accordants fold rapidly against an advancing Onslaught formation. But despite the numbing scale of these defeats, crews are able to appreciate living quarters inspired by those found on the extremely accommodating Union-class battlecarriers.

Richly integrated with late Domain practices and Star Federation technology, the Accordant-class battlecruiser was at least a massive step forward in shipbuilding expertise. This knowledge would be quickly applied to the still-in-development Rebellion-class battleship, even if the ensuing production of said battleships would choke out nanoforge production bandwidth from Accordant and Union alike.",,,
fed_boss,SHIP,"A symbol of terrible might from a bygone era, this relic battleship unleashes awesome firepower for an equally awesome logistical cost. Anything caught in the way of this monstrous vessel will suffer the attention of its numerous frontal batteries, and that which isn't will be washed away by waves of destructive energy. Given the immense resources and coordination required to design a warship of this caliber, how the breakaway state like the Star Federation came to field such a vessel is a mystery. 

Why the Domain let precious AI cores fall into the hands of a partial-breakaway state like the Federation is unclear. Nevertheless, this siege vessel bears the handiwork of an AI architect. The unused drone tunnels, a lack of internal access points, missing blackbox systems, and an abundance of data-processing centers suggest this hull might have been entirely automated with just a few more years of development. Surely though, that would be a terrible mistake.

Stigmatized and shunned, the Rebellion-class' menacing silhouette is rarely seen today. During the first AI War, technocrats were able to convince the Tri-Tachyon Corporation to authorize a covert deployment of Rebellions en-masse to all non-core Federation colonies. While this likely saved the independence of the Federation as a whole from the Hegemony's imperialist advances, the Hegemony's relations with the Federation remain tense to this day. Through the cycles, the Rebellion's deployment has been red-taped by the political maneuvering of pro-Hegemony conservatives, largely enabled by the industrialist party's reluctance to fund the Federation's navy.

Rumors say there were proposed plans to make the Rebellion an even larger vessel. Proposedly split into three separate hulls, each with different power grids, this class of megaship would have likely demanded the attention of entire fleets. Unsurprisingly, the size of such a hull is assumed to be impossible with current technologies. And given the remarkable upkeep of existing Rebellion-class ships, it would likely be an impractical logistical burden, nevermind a strategically-unwieldy method of force projection.",,,
fed_medcombtanker,SHIP,"The Egret defies its elegant namesake by appearing as a chaotic fusion of different ships. More of a Tri-PocketKnife in starship form, this Frankenstein of a vessel offers all the tedium of cargo and fuel hauling, the tragedy of risky salvage accidents, and the boredom of cycle-long survey missions. But, worst of all, is the terrifying thought of having to enter battle as a warship. A sturdy hull and strong emitter are enough to handle smaller threats, but the lack of proper armament is a major disadvantage in heavy combat. It is also endowed with a maintenance bill that is high for its size, as the numerous systems crammed into the hull require more service hours than any other civilian ship. 

Having changed greatly over the cycles leading up the to Collapse, the Egret design actually started as a maintenance craft intended to service errant automated drones and distant Hypercomm relays. The Star Federation continues to prefer it as a combat-capable conscript tanker in these tumultuous times, but it is also prized among small, independent crews of scavengers for its ubiquity and range. ",,,
fed_heavyfreighter,SHIP,"The design of the Bison is hardly a homage to the art of starship aesthetic. Neither cheap to maintain like a civilian hauler or as capable as a true combat freighter, the one benefit it offers is escape potential. A light defense array theoretically grants it enough time to use its powerful burst engines to escape from pursing cruisers. The unfortunate truth is that its pre-militarized drive field is hard to improve without drastic (and difficult) aftermarket modifications, dissuading all but the richest or most desperate clientele. Still, given the current tumultuous state of the sector, some buyers and sellers lean towards paying the premium for reliability. The catch is often a competitively-priced price tag, of course - even if it's hard to put a price on peace of mind.

By nature of Domain colonies the Star Federation formed from, there were often vast distances between its members. Much of it could be filled with hostile Domain remnants, disillusioned or wayward colonists who resorted to piracy, and the luddic extremists who opposed the technocratic leadership in Federation politics. This hostile space demanded a class of logistical ship capable of traversing lightyears of space the relatively young Federation could ill-afford to patrol. The Bison in particular was intended to be the relative high-efficiency hauler for these sectors, but was nearly as uncomfortable to serve on as the Colossus-class haulers it replaced. To little surprise, the Bison saw a decline in production once the larger (and much more homely) Perseverance-class finally entered production. ",,,
fed_superkestrel,SHIP,"The Resolute is a patchwork behemoth of a siege ship hailing from the Federation's earliest days. Wielding an awesome amount of firepower similar to that of ground-based heavy batteries, this ship pays for its strength by eschewing a true shield emitter and proper capital-grade propulsion system. In return, very few ships - and even stations - can withstand the onslaught of its guns. Half-hearted attempts to modernize the hull before the collapse imbued the aging Resolute with wildly advanced features like a secondary shield and attack drones, though keen opponents would note these are merely rudimentary defenses. This capital ship is more like a large city for crew responsible for maintaining its considerable sprawl, which can be quite an effort given its sub-par defenses.

The Resolute is a product of an early Star Federation needing a capital ship compatible with its emergent industrial base - mainly a design capable of working with extreme manufacturing concessions and a lack of Domain-exclusive technologies. As such, many of the Resolute components share similarities with commonly available civilian-grade forge templates, and the design itself is more or less militarized through sheer redundancy. Several cycles of comprehensive refits adding layers and superstructures also reinforce the appearance of an haphazard juggernaut. Maintenance profiles, understandably, exceed that of similar tonnages due to the overblown scope of its systems.

A group of conservative military elements within the Star Federation believe the Resolute is the be-all-end-all of warships, who insist there is no effective replacement for the brutal firepower and hard labor of the Resolute's massive crew complement. Despite their proclamations, a  significant portion of the Star Federation's reserve fleet consists of these aging hulks, slowly superseded by production runs of the newer Union and Accordant hulls.",,,

The Erandi-Utopia megacorporation began terraforming the planet during the early days of Domain settlement, but their efforts were abruptly halted when Scarian colonists decided to join the Star Federation. It's widely believed that this was a preemptive punishment orchestrated by the Domain, leaving Scaria with an underdeveloped surface. Evidence of further retribution can be seen in the scattered wreckage of attack drones and industrial pollution from starship construction that was necessary to defend against them. For those who can afford it, the safest option is to live near the frozen poles or in one of the orbiting habitats.",,"A layer of haze lingers above the pale storm cells of Scaria, much like the cloudy eye of a blind old animal.

The air on Pale Twin is made breathable by genetically modified lichen, which was seeded by the Domain in the rush to terraform Octavia. Although the lichen still grows on rocks, the evaporation of the planet's atmosphere has resulted in dangerously low levels of oxygen. The luddics among the planet's inhabitants views Pale Twin as a sacred site that honors the planet's past life and serves as a reminder of the significance of natural water in the cosmos. The Luddics among the population see the planet as a shrine to previous life, mainly as a reminder that natural water is the cosmos is the greatest gift.

The presence of these minerals suggests that the planet was originally formed closer to the sun but was later ejected into a far orbit after gravitic interaction with a rogue planet or other celestial body. This fortuitous trajectory allowed Cessitoc to collect the gases and volatiles present in the outer solar system, creating an environment that was ideal for resource-hungry Domain planners.",,"Cessitoc is a poisonous planet filled with danger, yet its abundant mineral deposits make it an attractive destination for those willing to brave its hazardous conditions. The planet's dangerous mines can still be made profitable, but only by those who can endure the monotony of undergrounder life. During the early days of Domain colonization, Cessitoc was heavily exploited to build the next wave of Explorarium drones using giant orbital forge stations. However, these Domain-era relics were somehow lost during the first AI war when Tri-Tachyon seized control of the existing independent colony, using it as a strategic waypoint for the entirety of the conflict.

star_federation,FACTION,"During the Domain era, the Star Federation was formed as a loose alliance of colonies spanning twelve star systems. Seeking to overcome the Domain's careful resource compartmentalization and industrial capacity restrictions, the colonies collaborated by sharing technology through makeshift hyperwave transmitters and quietly routing shipments of resources between each other. However, their cooperative efforts were soon discovered, particularly when they began testing native ""warp"" beacon technology to bypass potential controls of the Gate system. The Domain's immediate military response the provoked the Federation into strengthened their defense charter, throwing the whole faction into a defensive war they were losing right up until the day of the Collapse. Ultimately their efforts were in vain, for all warp beacons were rendered by inert the same unseen event that shut the gates.

As the terror of the Collapse claimed its first victims of the distant colonies, among them were Federation members declining from civil unrest, geographic isolation, and ruin inflicted by Domain strikes. The sole exception was the Federation world of Scaria, a relatively new member known for a mature industrial base and democratizing government. Even as the AI wars raged, the Octavian system leveraged its self-proclaimed neutrality to foster quiet cross-faction trade deals or arbitrate unproductive peace talks. Any invasions or hostilities were fended off by a considerable pre-Collapse buildup of Rebellion-class battleships.

Whatever the Star Federation has become hasn't remained totally unscathed, for relationships with other factions are anything but simple. The Hegemony has disdain for the Federation's anti-Domain history and defensive measures taken during the AI wars, even if both factions share disdain for the tyrannical Sindrian regime and corrupt Persean League. The Federation and Luddic Church relationship is cold due to the Federation's pro-technology disposition and history of Luddic persecution, despite limited cooperation in Federation's humanitarian efforts building positive sentiment in Church moderates. In the opposite corner of ideology, Tri-Tachyon makes no effort to hide its disdain for the numerous anti-competition measures passed by Scarian counselors, but is perhaps content to buy shares and failing subsidiaries whenever it can.

Like things are in the Persean sector these days, the Star Federation suffers more than the deterioration of its physical form: As the sector's receding economy wears away Federation industries, a growing number of its elected councilors express desire to permanently ally with various sector factions. Only time will tell if one of these internal movements gains enough control to cement relations with their desired allies, or condemn the system into ruin for merely trying.",,,

Despite this, it maintains excellent - if self-endangering - combat pressure thanks to ludicrous antimatter-assisted boosters.

In the lull between the two AI wars, a leak of some highly confidential Federation documents detailed the extensive trials of a semi-refurbished Basilisk derelict. Though the original hull is presumed to have been scrapped, the secret about this brilliant red vessel has floated around the Holonet ever since. Seemingly made without the engineering techniques native to the Persean sector and the mainstay domain, the original craftsmanship is a crude form of high-tech. What few facts were learned about its origins still circulates the various networks with idle interest and theories following it, though it has been many cycles since the original discovery. Perhaps forgotten swaths of the Persean sector will reveal others of its kind?

fed_cruisercarrier,SHIP,"The venerable C1500-series ""Calvacade"" specializes in line-combat and decisive strikes with fighters and weapons alike. Being far more ubiquitious than other ""cruiser school"" hulls, the ship is well-armed and decently quick at full engine power. Notable features include an advanced communication array which enables rapid fighter maneuvers, a miniaturized accelerated ammo feeder system for coordinated gun strikes, and dedicated rescue shuttles that keep pilot losses to a minimum. While much beloved by its spacer crews, the cost of operation typically outclasses those of dedicated attack ships and support carriers.

Conversely, a Calvacade's pilots may experience a sense of unease when the advanced uplink unexpectedly disables their controls so the ""combat coordination"" computer can take over their fighters. While the computer-guided maneuvers allow for uncanny speeds and inhuman reactions, pilots often report discomfort from the intense g-forces and higher speeds. There is also a stigma around the computer's decision-making abilities, with the occasional pilot realizing the computer may coldly prioritize the survival of the wing over an individual fighter. Nonetheless, the high survival rate provided by the recovery shuttles typically mitigates any negative impact this rumor might have on fighter-jockey ranks.

Once tested with swappable logistical packages replacing the gun and lower hangar pontoons, Federation naval architects discovered the Calvacade's usefulness as a civilian hauler is hampered by the relative complexity and odd hullshape. The program was easily scrapped to make assets available for other projects, mostly because involved officers saw no need to change a well designed combat carrier.

Though entirely different from tachyon-based effects, the understanding of this complex weapon has been lost to time and blackbox hardware. Presumably developed to disable large civilian starships without causing serious destruction, the threat of overloading or widespread system failure often causes more damage than it intends to. Nimble military-grade combatants can at least attempt to avoid the barrage altogether, while larger ships often have better redundancy or hardened equipment.

The oddest aspect about this weapon is the effect on conscious biological targets. As discovered in unencrypted documentation in data files, a low power version of the weapon scoring a direct hit on a power armor user will place them into a coma-like state for up to 5 minutes. This knockout effect also extends to the crew behind ship bulkheads, though they can often be stim-shocked out of the dazed state.",,,

This grants it the ability to deploy a fleet-protecting shield, even if the technology is fickle and not an outright replacement for normal shielding. Despite the benefits it brings in combat, the immense size of the hull and provides a challenge to maintenance crews and fleet coordinators alike.

Military strategists may scoff at the notion of using a freighter in combat, but these ships proved highly effective in patrolling the wastes between early Federalized systems. They were also successfully employed in convoy missions, with their powerful guns dissuading all but the most foolhardy or well-equipped pirates. However, it was not until the late Expansion period, with the installation of the infamous fleetshield, that this ship truly earned its place as the legendary fleetship of the Federation.

The revered ""fleetships"" of the former Star Federation have become increasingly scarce since the Collapse, much like the notorious Rebellion-class battleships. The difference is that their rarity is not caused by stigmata, but because of the exorbitant expenses involved in deploying them. Perseverance-class fleetships of the current cycle are thus found most in drydocks or critical convoys. Nevertheless, the presence of even one Perseverance--particularly when accompanied by a few escort vessels--is more than enough to dissuade hostile fleets from attacking in the first place.

Life on a Perseverance is often compared to civilian life, which is a welcome change of pace in the desolate reaches of the Persean fringe. While crew members still adhere to typical spacer practices like water and nutrient bar rations, the ship boasts a total of four bars, two holo-entertainemnt complexes, an exercise facility (complete with a real water swimming pool), and even hydroponics bays which provide a limited supply of fresh food.

A perfect ship for ambitious Star Federation officers looking for career-advancing glories, but exceedingly rare due to construction costs.

Built during the peak of Star Federation design capability, the lack of widespread ergonomics indicates part of its design was assisted by an AI. It could also have been the work of an overworked weapon-system architect doubly-assigned to the design of the crew accommodations. The Emerillon also lacks standardized parts, much to the irritation of maintenance crew, which is odd considering the design archetypes it shares with many Star Federation ships.

Of course, an even more advanced blueprint is rumored to be floating around on the Dark Holonet.

The crystals appear to be a kind of temporal resonance generators, a concept once thought exclusive to ultra-rare prototype Tri-Tachyon hulls. Bathing the hull in the ethereal glow of temporal disassociation, powering these assemblies collapses them into non-euclidian constructs which pulls the ship into a chronal paradox, even surpassing the dilation inherent to phase drives in short bursts.

It is one of the least unique among lost vessels found in fringe sectors, but perhaps that which is most familiar can also be the most useful.

Though the true story of this hull may be forever lost, evidence of the Federation's legacy remains on-board. Specifically, ""warp"" jump-drives once promised mid-range intergalactic traversal without the need for gates. Jump beacons connected Federation systems and provided convienient access to their overspecialized industrial bases, much to the ire of Domain planners. Unfortunately, with the Collapse, the light of the Jump Beacons was also snuffed out, and any jump-drive ships in transit were scattershot across the far stars Persean region. Much of them are purportedly like the Shivan's design, though a few other patterns have been discovered across the cycles. 

Holonet speculation is intriguiging: Perhaps some sort of mass retreat of the Shivan's creators was in order? Few ship examples exist in the public space, and their computers are unhelpfully fried from lightyears of dissonant hyperwarp. The Octavian Federal High Command has never been particularly talkative about the Collapse, much preferring to look to the future. Some more questionable claims suggest there is a datavault on pre-Collapse activities in the Command Spire, still sealed to this day.",,,
fed_polyp,SHIP,"A mysterious jellyfish-like frigate marked by a unique phase-displacement and oversized weapons package. Though the craft's single phase coil is undersized for the displacement, several phase-resonant filaments seem to bind the hull a curious area of positively-charged p-space. The rest of frigate largely conforms to the Star Federation's mundane standards, save for a curious pair of shock vanes providing point defense coverage.

Quite a cramped ship that presents itself like the inside of a creatures' ribcage, the Polyp has a disturbing lack of access points for critical life support systems. While being unable to directly interact with essential equipemnt like air cyclers suggests an impossible level of design oversight, a compliment of slug-like repair drones quickly attends to minor ship damage by excreting a rapidly-hardening smart repair gel.

Both scale higher depending on the ship's flux level.",
fed_boss_surge,WEAPON,"The immense flux core of the Rebellion is uniquely suited to dumping overload energy into space. The wavefront is incredibly destructive at close range and is laden with enough ionic energy to disrupt an entire fleet. While friendly ships can polarize themselves for immunity, any nearby enemies or neutral entities will be affected.",Superweapon,,
fed_boss_rebel,SHIP,"A Rebellion given a hostile coat of orange paint and glimmering neon-teal lines, this battleship is a modification of the Rebellion used by seditious Federation worlds siding with the Hegemony during the Second AI war. Though the war ended with the signing of the treaty, and these rebellious worlds collapsed without support, the havoc these distinctive vessels caused undoubtably left Scaria the only unruined Federation world. Like most traitor assets, these models were captured, evaluated, and then disposed of by letting them fall into crushing depths of a gas giant.

Opponents are quick to see how the powerful energy weapon grid has been exchanged for numerous ammunition bunkers and ammo-feed lines. This brutal vessel is much more potent at standoff ranges than the mainline version, though at a marginal cost to its shield and flux systems. It is also somewhat more intensive to maintain, given the amount of ammunition required to fire so many gun batteries.

Developed quite near the Collapse, the templates of this siege vessel bear the distinctive work of an AI architect. Difficult to service junctions, a lack of internal access points, blackbox technologies, and a central hab-zone crossed by more coolant lines and data-processing terminals than usual. This vessel could likely have been entirely automated with just a few more years of development. Surely, though, that would be an incredibly bad idea.",,,

fed_hullbeam_med,WEAPON,"A fairly unimpressive anti-armor beam at a glance, the Hull Beam produces powerful ""particle spall"" explosions that ruin exposed hull.

Theoretical physicists imagine the effects of these ""hull beams"" originate from a quantum pairing effect between virtual particles in our spacetime and those of the infamous P-space dimension. The rapid oscillation of each other's phases between dimensions destabilizes, managing to produce twice the destructive effect when the particle stream is interrupted by a physical object. The charged nature of intruding particles means it is attracted to physical components, producing little hyperspace distortions that violently ionize pockets of gas. The result is devastating against pressurized bulkheads left uncovered by armor or shielding.

Initially created through Koralia Advanced Energy's Civilian Applications initiative, the Hullbeam series were developed after corporate executives observed the powerful fragmentation effects on starship hull by the simplistic Microbeam crystal. It was thought that a more mature crystal, perhaps with unstable qualities, could produce the same effect on non-energetic targets like asteroids. This was unfortunately not true, and the lethargic particle stream seemed underwhelming despite its more pronounced effects against armor panels. It wasn't even imagined that the partner beam's destabilization would create interdimensional fractures, thereby saving the concept with a brand new prototype weapon budget.",Anti Armor,,
fed_hullbeam_large,WEAPON,"Though not an outstanding weapon if solely judged by the hard-number specifications, the secondary cavitation and explosive effects produced by this beam can rupture exposed hull to a fatal degree.

Theoretical physicists imagine the effects of these ""hull beams"" originate from a quantum pairing effect between virtual particles in our spacetime and those of the infamous P-space dimension.

The charged nature of intruding particles means it is attracted to physical components, producing little hyperspace distortions that violently ionize pockets of gas. The result is devastating against pressurized bulkheads left uncovered by armor or shielding.

Lacking the ability to perhaps ""study"" these virtual P-space, particle weapon engineers can only observe how the crystal assembly seems to be slightly phased at one end. Likely a consequence of the time spent extruding the crystal in its zero-G forge, the maturity of the phased lattice means it usually starts to sprout physical growths. These are filed off through physical abrasion, for the same explosive effects produced by the beam can occur when using a high-powered cutting beam.",Anti Armor,,

fed_pikebeam,WEAPON,"The long accelerator rail and upscaled capacitors of the Pike allow it to pressure targets from afar. Somewhat underpowered versus shields and armor, but ideal for support vessels and light craft.

Essentially the same ""caliber"" as the Microbeam, the Pike's introduction came relatively quickly as Federation weapon design institutions struggled with new lens refinement and energy pump mechanisms. Though the ungainly particle chute greatly accelerated the stream, the effect of the beam impact remained oddly unchanged.

Licensed and built by Koralia Advanced Energy after the Collapse, the infamously long silhouette of the Pike seems to amuse the crew of the ships wielding it. Much less so to the officers and crew - for the constant jokes about ""compensating"" for something grow tiresome quickly. Crew rotation through Pikebeam ops teams are approximately double or triple that of other weapons, so the saying goes.",Close Support,,
fed_minibeam,WEAPON,"A snub-nosed exotic particle beam with good range and punch. Nearly useless versus shields, but produces a destructive spalling effect on bare hull. 

Powered by a mysterious crystal substrate, the base-emitter of the Microbeam is grown from a fragment of crystal sample distributed across several forge facilities. Each beam shard is grown in conditions that could only be described as a ""stellar nursery"", an extremely hot but somewhat low-pressure atomic soup pulsed by radiation. Most crystals come out malformed, but a few can be extracted, milled down, and eventually fitted to the frame of a weapon.

A simple discharge can be achieved by cryogenically cooling the medium until it starts bleeding excess energy. The larger the core is, the longer it takes to discharge - but all produce a stream of exotic, unstable, and even virtual particles. Such short-lived and enigmatic things were seemingly difficult to study even before the Collapse, nevermind in the state of the post-Collapse conditions.",Close Support,,
