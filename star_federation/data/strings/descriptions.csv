fed_burstlaser1,WEAPON,"A plasma pulse repeater offering best-in-class burst potential, disruptive polarity charge, all at a reasonable mounting cost. Throughput suffers massively once capacitors are exhausted.

Often reputed as the wealthy merchant-marine's ""self-defense weapon of choice"", the Light Pulser is economical and potent versus the shoddy armor plating of pirate raiders. Solely owning the design and manufacturing rights at the start of the Collapse, Gygas Industries profited millions of centi-credits as the sector's security deteriorated.

Small enough to be mounted on ground installations, the plasmatic nature of the Light Pulser's projectile can survive in many atmospheric mediums. When not fighting starships, this weapon is a brutal anti-vehicle and bombardment platform - albeit at the cost of an installation's powergrid.",General,,
fed_burstlaser2,WEAPON,"A capacitor-fed, burst-operated weapon with surprising efficiency against armored targets, though systemic modifications are required to prolong maximum output.

Developed by Gygas Industries on Cessitoc's northern pole, the Pulser series often went under civilian modifications to scale back its power requirements. This was often done to ease the mounting costs of a proper weapon, which was a middle ground between crews demanding anti-pirate measures and the margins to be made with expanded cargo hold mods. Gygas declared all postmarket powerplant alterations ""actionably illegal"" shortly after catching wind of the trend, fearing the power-starved variants would ruin the image of the Pulser brand.

Gygas Industries still failed to secure Pulser production contracts outside of the Star Federation Navy. Neither megacorp nor the Domain Naval Procurement agency found the weapon to be worth the steep purchase cost, especially when existing high-tech ships were rare.",General,,
fed_burstlaser3,WEAPON,"A high-performance variant of plasma pulser with impressive volley damage and reasonable armor efficiency. A good generalist weapon, if not restrained by capacitor size.

The largest pulse weapon developed by Gygas Industries, and more akin to a plasma mortar because of its ability to punch through armor. The Ultraheavy Pulser never saw great production throughout the sector due to its complexity and draconian manufacturing licensing, for the latter was never removed - even after it failed to qualify for Domain procurement. Since the Star Federation was the only faction in close proximity to Gygas's polar complex, they were able to sieze the entire complex of the disintegrating megacorporation. The holonet rumors that Scaria's defense drone relic came from within the vaults of Gygas, perhaps with several dreaded planet killer devices.

The UH-Pulser is said by some to be the worst of both worlds. Lacking the obliteration of the arcane Plasma Cannons, the sharp kick of a fully powered Autopulse, and especially the devastating wash of the Tacyhon Lance. Still, a few examples have seen these large cannons mounted on planetary installations, as they can provide anti-ship fire in atmospheric conditions. A quick burst from synchronized batteries dries up evasion vectors quickly, and the cohesive pulse-plasma is effective at incredible distances.",General,,
fed_flak1,WEAPON,"A light cannon that fires a small spread of multipurpose projectiles. While individually weak and therefore less effective against armor, the raw damage can overwhelm lighter shield generators.

The specially-designed projectiles of Scrapshot weapons collapse inwards on themselves on impact, fusing their cores in a millionth of a second. The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components. Though its ability to punish shield generators is appreciated, its weak effect on hull has earned it the moniker ""sparkleshot"" among its gun crews.",Close Support,,
fed_flak2,WEAPON,"A medium cannon that fires a large spread of multipurpose projectiles. While individually weak and therefore less effective against armor, the raw damage is able to overwhelm shield generators. The large amount of shrapnel can also disrupt sensitive components.

The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components.

The resulting micro-fusion bursts cause equal damage across all types of defense and produce electromagnetic effects that potentially disrupt weaker components. A pre-Domain invasion concept, this weapon was merely improved and scaled for Federation use with the assistance of the ENGICore AI network. It saw little usefulness against ensuing Domain drone swarms, whose sturdy and unshielded hulls could easily absorb the stray fragments. Said drones also ensured the factories and labs responsible for improving Scrapshots were razed to the ground.",Close Support,,

The collection of consciousnesses within ENGICore concluded Federation technological advances would be unable to produce small beam weapons with cost-effective stopping power. Their solution yielded a miniaturized device firing a pulse of poorly understood particles, seemingly existing between hyperspace and realspace for an incredibly short period.

fed_artbeam,WEAPON,"A ship-sized beam built into the core of the Osprey-class cruiser. Capable of obliterating unshielded targets and initiating EMP cascades through shields. A lengthy shutdown delay ensures local p-space does not catastrophically rupture from sustained usage.

Built around a vast array of crystalline mediums, the fusion of these independent nodes produces incomprehensibly energetic anomalies on downrange targets. Seemingly scaling with mass displacement, the powerful flow of virtual particles blasts through all but the hardiest of armor and hull. The fervent cascade of energy through the crystals is so great that field dampers are required to stop energy rifts from appearing inside the array mechanisms. ",Close Support,,

fed_beam_halberd,WEAPON,"A rare and powerful strike beam, the bulky accelerator assembly of the Halberd beam allows it to spall through strained shields. Incredibly effective despite its limited range and taxing power draw.

Somewhat under-engineered, the Halberd compresses a wide emission stream into a narrow lance using strange hypercooled field emitters in its prongs. As the base emitter fires longer, virtual particle pressure increases at the chokepoint, somehow self-annihilating and reforming into a more powerful directed energy stream. This configuration requires hypercooling mechanisms that push the edge of cryogenic applications and create a huge maintenance overhead, but produce an uncannily powerful beam.

Undoubtedly AI-developed, this highly unusual weapon represents the last iterations of Star Federation pre-Collapse technology. Only surpassed by the Glaive (which is a different weapon mechanism entirely), it is nearly just as rare.",Strike,,
fed_beam_glaive,WEAPON,"Capable of obliterating entire ships with a single burst, the Glaive is a formidable beam cannon known for its devastating power. A low base range is offset its ability to pierce the shields of flux-stressed shields and obliterate fighters.

An extremely advanced weapon, the Glaive uses a collection of bizarre crystalline virtual particle emitters to saturate the orbit of a micro-singularity inside the weapon. By slowly collapsing the singularity, the explosive discharge of escaping accretion can be focused through its signature front-mounted aperture. It is a feat only possible with double the amount of containment field emitters and a-grav generators found on most Mastery-era frigates.

Star Federation officials are keen to keep this weapon exclusively in the hands of Federation armories, for its mere silhouette serves as an incredible source of recruiting material or morale boost for crews.

Controversial in nature due to their autonomus capacity, the crude combat intelligence of the Omnidrone has been tethered to the fielding ship's datastream. While this avoids the scrutiny of AI regulators, the Delta-class AI removal has severely restricted the range. Despite this mitigation, Omnidrones continue to be mounted on Federation hulls to help obliterate stray frigates and finish off crippled cruisers.",,,
fed_talos,SHIP,"The Brane-class is a chip-hacked variant of a hunter-killer drone, altered by the inclusion of a habitation module replacing its theoretical robotic inhabitant. The unusually sparse weapons array is substantiated by a feed-acceleration mechanism and stronger shield generator, both made possible by a lack of human-traversible comparments.  A minor point defense array supplements its staying power, much to the irritation of its cramped crew.

In the early days of their settling of the Persean arm, the Star Federation employed heavy use of fully automated Brane droneships to discourage upstarting piracy. Such AI vessels were patient and tenacious hunters, capable of waiting nearly for weeks in anticipation of a target. Originally deployed by hyperspace-capable drone tenders, the drones have since been retrofitted with all of the necessary equipment for crew and hyperspace space travel. Some patrol commanders even let the crew board a more hospitable vessel during extended periods of downtime.",,,
fed_byte,SHIP,"The Byte is a chip-hacked autodrone with a habitation and command module instead of an AI core housing. Such a tiny ship achieves awesome firepower because it dedicates less volume to human life support and facilities.  This also means it is equally as fragile, lacking many non-critical systems that could potentially absorb a stray shot.

In the early days of their settling of the Persean arm, the Star Federation employed heavy use of fully automated Byte droneships to discourage budding piracy. Such AI vessels were patient and tenacious hunters, capable of waiting nearly for weeks in anticipation of a target.

fed_tern,SHIP,"A large and well-armed line-frigate with a comfortable interior to distract its crew from a lack of modular point-defense mounts. Whether a Bell is outfitted for fleet support or frigate hunting, its limited weapon count demands specialization that befits its intended role. Some private buyers find its lack of flexibility disturbing, but the Star Federation is infamous for issuing these ships to just about every fleet.

The Bell is an iconic ship that holds a special place in the history of the Federation. As one of the first vessels to be designed by the Federation naval architects, it served as a testbed for early experiments in technology that deviated from Domain standards. Over the years, it underwent several modernization efforts, each adding progressively more advanced features while still retaining its iconic two-nacelle design. Although it was originally slated for a final, ultra-high-tech upgrade, the Federation High Command eventually redirected the refit funding to focus on the production of ever-larger capital ships.

Contrary to spacer jokes old, this generation of the Bell has very adequate fuel tanks; only the most careless of commanding officers should find themselves begging passing starfarers for fuel.",,,
fed_lightdestroyer,SHIP,"The Invader is an adrenaline-inducing assignment for junior officers with excellent speed and appreciable weapon hardpoints. More wary captains and keen opponents will observe the lack of point defense and thin hull plating, not to mention uncountable situations unsolvable by its doctrine of outright aggression. 

In spite of the critics, the statistical kill count on ""piratical"" craft far exceeds that of other Federation destroyers. Its modest success means the Invader has remained roughly similar over the epochs; it is little more than a weapon hardpoints welded to a high-spec reactor, plasma-compressor engines surrounded by a curving thermal disspator shell, and a somewhat servicable habitation spar on the front of it all. 

Being the most predominant of the Star Federation's deep-space hunter craft, the Invader's reputation is tarnished by numerous incidents regarding the behavior of its captaincy. Perhaps given an intoxicating sense of independence as they left Federation space to pursue criminals, or even driven to desparation for supplies, these rogue officers purportedly acted no better than the pirates they pursued. Rumor has it these bad apples were planted by precautionary Domain planners seeking to slow the Federation's growth, but there are very few theories one cannot find on the TriNet. ",,,
fed_cormorant,SHIP,"An overgunned ship with a truly fearsome strike and support potential, the Daptrius is known for its high-energy superchargers and numerous missile hardpoints. Ballistic-preferring tacticians and commanders in the Federation are weary of it more than most high-tech Federation designs; a short-range energy destroyer without extraordinary mobility makes for an easy target. Conversely, more audacious captain can appreciate the Datptrius's unlockable potential through the use of safety overrides. 

Even discounting its odd combat profile, the Daptrius meshes well with the slower pace of Federation fleet action. Many in administration roles believe it to excellent introduction to energy systems for new enlistees, eventually increasing the amount of experienced ensigns preferred for high-tech capital ships. 

Initially planned as a replacement for the old Brava gun-barge, the ambitious Federation/Tri-Tachyon subsidiary project was 'completed' just tens of cycles before the Collapse. Both entities desired ubiquitous destroyer with low production and maintenance overheads, with the decision made to let the Federation handle general construction and TT provide systems expertise and production capital. When the finished prototype failed to meet TT's high expectations for speed and defense, it was no surprise that Tri-Tachyon's subsidiary refused to provide funding for the full production run. Perhaps attempting to save credibility, or possibly attempting to rebuff the megacorporation for its rejection, the Federation decided to allocate funds for double the original hull quota. ",,,
fed_cormorant_old,SHIP,"A stocky vessel designed to pose a threat to cruisers, the Cormorant is bristling with missiles and gun batteries. This older model destroyer follows a practical and simplistic doctrine: Missiles are limited, but so are enemy reinforcements. The later inclusion of a missile microforge mitigates the ship's issues ammunition scarcity, but brought with it  maintenence costs comparable to higher-end destroyers.

With the Cormorant's age comes a ruggedness and simplicity in many areas, including habitation facilities. Its crew sometimes compare it to the grueling interiors of early Old Earth submersible vessels, or at least whatever concerning claims pre-Holovid media is able to make of them. Still, most veterans know only the greenest spacers are disturbed by rest-shifts between warhead racks and propellant silos.",,,
fed_rigger,SHIP,"A modernized variant of an old drone tender, the Centa's fighter complement is backed up by respectable missile capacity. Despite the significant comprimises to structural integrity inflicted by each added launch bay, the barge framework is quite a frontier-friendly design with generous technical specifications that accept lots of ""creativity"". Default configs include generous cargo and comfortable crew quarters, which makes the hull endearing to explorers and scavengers.

Early Federation colonies couldn't always provide maintenance and repair depots for starships, but many operated a Centa-class repair rigger to deploy surface-built repair drones. The Centa variant seen in the Sector today features a standard LPC nanoforge, for the repair drones are not suited for in-combat engagements.



",,,
fed_rigger_firesupport,SHIP,"A straightforward design with an emphasis on guns, the Brava-class is an easy way to bring fire support in small to mid-sized battles. While slightly reminiscent of the prevalent Sunder-class energy destroyer, the shorter range of high-throughput ballistics can entrap an unwary captain in terrible situations. 

Developed shortly after the Bell as a proud ""native"" design, the Brava's firepower advantage was crucial in the fight against thickly-armored attack drones. Though unpopular with crews until the habitation module was extended and updated, the Brava remained a staple of planetary garrisons throughout Federation space. Some models even featured a drone bay on the backside of the body module, but most were phased out following the development of the Centa-class dedicated carrier.

Little more than a platform made to deliver capital-grade firepower, the Brava-class has found surprising success in the Sector by serving as port guard. Leaving escorting and chasing to smaller skiffs and corvettes, the mere sight of the Brava's large guns is enough to deter all manner of conflicts or violators. These ""berth-sitter"" Bravas largely spend their time as a pseudo honor-guard; a career defined by drifting along civilian traffic corridors, maintaining flawless hull paneling, and helping with inspection details.",,,
fed_stealth,SHIP,"One of the few Star Federation ships to sport phase technology, the Nesasio is terrifyingly overarmed for a phasecraft. While most Domain phasecraft rely on unique capabilities to inflict damage, the Nesasio leverages powerful AM-boosted engines to ensure the totality of its payload is delivered. Lacking the hull and armor to engage enemies head on, this sleek vessel typically preys on unsuspecting or straying targets. A lack of dedicated point defense solutions can leave it surprisingly vulnerable to fightercraft and missile threats.

The Nesasio-class certainly bears little resemblance to most Tri-Tachyon phase designs. At face value, the neutrino emissions are interpreted as an odd ""blue"" color, and only half the various internal actuators resemble known p-space actuators. Various prototype phase rigs--used exlusively by academics for research--often express unique color ""emissions"" too, but usually with impractical levels of coil instability. This is not true of the Nesasio and its relatively standard field grade, a fact that is just as peculiar as the Star Federation intelligence operatives who often serve as the Nesasio's commanding officer.

Few individuals claim to know the origin of this utterly strange vessel, much less how it came to be in the Star Federation's hands. Those who do whisper of dark labs in the interstellar void-shores of the Persean arm and gifts from ""Those Who Wait On The Other Side"". Such messages can also be found in TriVid starship-operas or obscure Holonet conspiracy videos.
",,,
fed_kestral,SHIP,"The signature ""tough little ship"" of the Star Federation, the Kestrel's nose plating is meant to compensate for the ship's lighter weapon array and generally slow speed. This armor module will absorb fire and insulate the hull from ionic damage, but isn't rated to shrug off massive detonations like true starship armor. While the ship may seem weak after the armor detatches from accrued damage, the vessel is normally able to continue the fight. Proficient captains who understand this limited protection realize allies are more important than the strength of an individual ship. Or so reads the manual.

A very early adopter of the ""cruiser school"" doctine popular in the Domain, the Kestrel was the earliest cruiser Federation industries could produce. Lacking Domain-restricted implements and facilities for capital starships, the Kestrel's ""pride-of-the-fleet"" status is reflected by the presence of thoughtful ergonomics and high-quality accomodiations. Later variants becoming the testbed for novel technologies such as missile-micro replication also affirmed its place as the unofficial Federation mascot; Model sales and holo-games featuring the Kestrel remain the biggest incomes for the civilian-facing divisions.

Star Federation legend (or propaganda) tells of a lone Kestrel defeating a defected Rebellion-class battleship. Though highly unlikely given the extreme threat posed by a Rebellion-class, simulations indicate it may have been possible with extreme modifications and immense skill.",,,
fed_raptor,SHIP,"An expensive cruiser defined by self-replenishing missile racks and the smallest known implmentation of the ZOLTAN shield system. A high-power targeting radar and predictive computer array enables the Jager launch missile strikes and ballistic barrages from great ranges, and theoretically using its secondary shield to keep the engines at full power without taking stray fire. A truly impressive display of Star Federation technology wrapped up in one cruiser, were it not for the limited endurance of its subsystems.

Even though it is not the most durable, elegant, or simpliest vessels, the Jager's chief value is all in the long-term economics. With the Federation preferring Jager variants that focus on close-support missiles and ballistics, the amount of credits spent repairing the ship hardware and paying out crew death policies is quite low. The presence of feedstock-accepting munition forges simplifies rearmament as much as it delights logisticans, even if that bandwidth is used to maintain the other complexities about the vessel.

Reflecting this conservative outlook on defense spending, Jager captains tend to have equally cautious personalities that inflame hotter-headed subordinates. Particulary bad derisions in the ship culture are reportedly more reminiscent of the politics found on planetside colonies. Bureaucrats who've dealt with the paperwork generated by ensuing Dereliction of Duty and Mutiny accusations likely find the similaity to said planetside politics ultimately tiresome, but would be unable to dismount the Jager's firm seat on the budget throne with complaints alone.",,,
fed_osprey,SHIP,"The Osprey is almost a literal glass cannon, seemingly more optical assemblies than bulkheads. Even though it has lower range than most artillery cruisers, the long-ranged ""Artillery Beam"" it unleashes will cripple enemies through their shields. Lacking a sufficient engineering budget for the ship system and defense turrets, the Osprey is the only Star Federation cruiser to utilize a simple defensive flak screen.

The trope of the young enlistee generally depicts the fearless, eager, and unwary: they often have nothing to lose. Such a spacer would prefer the glory of ships that use both speed and firepower to seize the day. This would mean they are seldom found on an Osprey, where they would quickly grow tired of its long maintenance shifts and cautious combat disposition. While only partially true, the Osprey certainly attracts crews in search of the slower and safer pace of a ""fleet"" ship. The Star Federation has little trouble filling berths with enlistees who have loved ones beyond their service, but this does mean Osprey losses often have devastating consequences for those at home.

Generally speaking, the Federation is known for an anti-war disposition and non-aggression policy - but an icon of war like the Osprey betrays how thin that facade can be. The extreme refinement of the Osprey suggests a greater level of AI co-development commonly later Star Federation hulls, with the Artillery Beam being an especially curious example. The Persean sector particle physics institutions--while magnitudes worse compared to those found in the time of the Domain--can deduce it involves the formation of anti-tachyons which experience time backwards in our universe. This stream appears to penetrate shields because the anti-tachyons have already formed inside of target, where they will encounter the positive-tachyon stream produced by a secondary beam assembly, annihilating themselves and most of the target in the process.

fed_flagship,SHIP,"The Union-class battlecarrier is a versatile vessel capable of relief campaigns, scientific surveys, and deep-space expeditions. In combat, the secondary shield, flexible weapon mounts, and respectable fighter complement give it an equally well-rounded presence. The Union played a critical role in the Federation's struggle for independence when the Domain began open conflict, becoming a vital tool for both military operations and relief efforts. Its Federation crews still view their strange-looking ship as a beacon of hope and a symbol of their resilience in the grim darkness of the Persean wastes.

Richly integrated with late Domain shipbuilding practices, the both the Union and Accordant were a massive step forward in shipbuilding expertise. Predating sleeker Accordant-class battlecruiser by just a cycle, the Union-class battlecarrier is distinguished by its round saucer section and wider set engine nacelles.  Knowledge gained in its production would be quickly applied to the still-in-development Rebellion-class battleship, though the ensuing production of said battleships would choke out nanoforge bandwidth from Accordants and Unions alike.

While the Union represents a golden age in the Star Federation's native industrial capacity, its sophistication the result of a co-development with an unscrupulous subsidiary of the ""Ko Combine"" megacorporation. The prototype's promised performance was able attract the attention of watchful Domain agents, though it was more likely valued as evidence of the megacorporation's solicitation of seditious worlds. The day after the prototype's completion, a small Domain taskforce utilized a dirty Ko Combine executive to smuggle off the sole prototype and destroy the covert shipbuilding facility with a hyperdrive overload. The Federation security council nevertheless funded construction of the required orbital constructions, eager to replace aging Resolute-class battleships and play down the Domain's interference.
",,,
fed_flagship_assault,SHIP,"A transitionary mid-to-high-tech battlecruiser, the Accordant's abundance of energy weapons and missiles give it a remarkable capacity for rapid assaults. Though designed to counter the Domain's rising preference for cruiser-school doctrine, the weaponized interdictor-pulse it emits can effectively pin down any size of ship and send entire figher wings crashing into unforgiving shields. Keen opponents would note the ship's relative fragility and short range, but also prepare for engines to suddenly go offline.

The Accordant the clenched fist to the Union's open palm, unafraid of waging war with its exotic Interdictor weapon and missile replicator systems. Its reputation is unfortunately tarnished by a terrible early service record; One particular pre-Collapse battle with hostile Domain forces saw several Accordants fold rapidly against an advancing Onslaught formation. But despite the numbing scale of these defeats, modern Sector crews are able to appreciate living amenities inspired by the extremely accommodating Union-class battlecarriers.

While not known to be made with the assistance of a Domain-associated megacorporation, the Accordant's smooth silhouette and advanced weaponry suggest a major departure from normal Federation capabilities. While it is simple to explain away with AI-assisted development, such an accusation would imply any high-tech hull is heavily influenced by AI design. Nevertheless, the Accordant is still the first example of native Star Federation capital ship; a that fact often repeated by Star Corps recruitment ad-holos.

fed_boss,SHIP,"A symbol of terrible might from a bygone era, this relic battleship unleashes awesome firepower for an equally awesome logistical cost. Anything caught in the way of this monstrous vessel will suffer the attention of its numerous frontal batteries, and that which isn't will be washed away by waves of destructive energy. Given the immense resources and coordination required to design a warship of this caliber, how the breakaway state like the Star Federation came to field such a vessel is a mystery. 

Why the Domain let precious AI cores fall into the hands of a partial-breakaway state like the Federation is unclear. Nevertheless, this siege vessel bears the handiwork of an AI architect. The unused drone tunnels, a lack of internal access points, missing blackbox systems, and an abundance of data-processing centers suggest this hull might have been entirely automated with just a few more years of development. Surely though, that would be a terrible mistake.

Stigmatized and shunned, the Rebellion-class' menacing silhouette is rarely seen today. During the first AI War, technocrats were able to convince the Tri-Tachyon Corporation to authorize a covert deployment of Rebellions en-masse to all non-core Federation colonies. While this likely saved the independence of the Federation as a whole from the Hegemony's imperialist advances, the Hegemony's relations with the Federation remain tense to this day. Through the cycles, the Rebellion's deployment has been red-taped by the political maneuvering of pro-Hegemony conservatives, largely enabled by the industrialist party's reluctance to fund the Federation's navy.

Rumors say there were proposed plans to make the Rebellion an even larger vessel. Proposedly split into three separate hulls, each with different power grids, this class of megaship would have likely demanded the attention of entire fleets. Unsurprisingly, the size of such a hull is assumed to be impossible with current technologies. And given the remarkable upkeep of existing Rebellion-class ships, it would likely be an impractical logistical burden, nevermind a strategically-unwieldy method of force projection.",,,
fed_medcombtanker,SHIP,"The Egret defies its elegant namesake by appearing as a chaotic fusion of different ships. More of a Tri-PocketKnife in starship form, this Frankenstein of a vessel offers all the tedium of cargo and fuel hauling, the tragedy of risky salvage accidents, and the boredom of cycle-long survey missions. But, worst of all, is the terrifying thought of having to enter battle as a warship. A sturdy hull and strong emitter are enough to handle smaller threats, but the lack of proper armament is a major disadvantage in heavy combat. It is also endowed with a maintenance bill that is high for its size, as the numerous systems crammed into the hull require more service hours than any other civilian ship. 

Having changed greatly over the cycles leading up the to Collapse, the Egret design actually started as a maintenance craft intended to service errant automated drones and distant Hypercomm relays. The Star Federation continues to prefer it as a combat-capable conscript tanker in these tumultuous times, but it is also prized among small, independent crews of scavengers for its ubiquity and range. ",,,
fed_heavyfreighter,SHIP,"The design of the Bison is hardly a homage to the art of starship aesthetic. Neither cheap to maintain like a civilian hauler or as capable as a true combat freighter, the one benefit it offers is escape potential. A light defense array theoretically grants it enough time to use its powerful burst engines to escape from pursing cruisers. The unfortunate truth is that its pre-militarized drive field is hard to improve without drastic (and difficult) aftermarket modifications, dissuading all but the richest or most desperate clientele. Still, given the current tumultuous state of the sector, some buyers and sellers lean towards paying the premium for reliability. The catch is often a competitively-priced price tag, of course - even if it's hard to put a price on peace of mind.

By nature of Domain colonies the Star Federation formed from, there were often vast distances between its members. Much of it could be filled with hostile Domain remnants, disillusioned or wayward colonists who resorted to piracy, and the luddic extremists who opposed the technocratic leadership in Federation politics. This hostile space demanded a class of logistical ship capable of traversing lightyears of space the relatively young Federation could ill-afford to patrol. The Bison in particular was intended to be the relative high-efficiency hauler for these sectors, but was nearly as uncomfortable to serve on as the Colossus-class haulers it replaced. To little surprise, the Bison saw a decline in production once the larger (and much more homely) Perseverance-class finally entered production. ",,,
fed_superkestrel,SHIP,"The Resolute is a patchwork behemoth of a siege ship hailing from the Federation's earliest days. Wielding an awesome amount of firepower similar to that of ground-based heavy batteries, this ship pays for its strength by eschewing a true shield emitter and proper capital-grade propulsion system. In return, very few ships - and even stations - can withstand the onslaught of its guns. Half-hearted attempts to modernize the hull before the collapse imbued the aging Resolute with wildly advanced features like a secondary shield and attack drones, though keen opponents would note these are merely makeshift defenses for a concerningly slow ship.

The Resolute is a product of an early Star Federation needing a capital ship compatible with its emergent industrial base. Necessitating a design capable of working with extreme manufacturing concessions and a lack of Domain-exclusive technologies, many of the Resolute components share similarities with commonly available civilian-grade patterns. The design itself is more or less militarized through sheer redundancy, nevermind the comprehensive refits adding layers of hull and machinery. Maintenance profiles, understandably, exceed that of similar tonnages due to the overblown scope of its systems.

A group of conservative military elements within the Star Federation believe the Resolute is the be-all-end-all of warships. Like many Hegemony high-families, such pundits believe there is no alternative to big guns, nor the hard labors demanded of the Resolute's massive crew complement. Despite their proclamations, a significant portion of the Star Federation's reserve fleet consists of these aging hulks, slowly superseded by production runs for newer Union and Accordant hulls.",,,

Almost exclusively a dismal corporate world in the pre-Collapse times, many post-Collapse entities seeking its profitability have come and gone (in typically violent fashions).

star_federation,FACTION,"The remnant of a pre-Collapse rebellion known to bypass Gates with ""warp"" beacons and requisite ""jump drives"", the Star Federation sought the same thing many other rebels wanted: freedom from the Domain of Man's brutal and ambitious rule. The nascent polity rebounded from Domain assaults using a network of Gateless ""dark"" colonies only accessible via jump-drive and cryptographic beacon codes. Were it not for the Collapse also affecting warp beacons, the Federation might have been able to persist beyond the silent Gates. 

Although the Star Federation is technically an independent polity, it is not treated as such by the more influential factions of the sector. The Hegemony is at odds with the Federation's anti-Domain origins and defensive measures taken during the AI wars, despite both sharing disdain for the blundering Sindrian regime and treacherous Tri-Tachyon corporation. The Luddic Church's relationship with the Federation is cold because of the Federation's pro-technology disposition and history of Luddic persecution, although limited cooperation through joint-faction humanitarian efforts has softened the zeal of Church moderates. Why the Star Federation has never joined the Persean League is a mystery, but the great Gens of Kazeron likely regard the Federation's mature shipbuilding industry a signficant threat to their business.

Yet this downsized Star Federation, like many things in the Persean sector of late, is suffering from more than just physical deterioration. Though the original seperatist councilors shared a vision for an egalitarian society supported by powerful relics of the Domain era, a growing (and diverse) fraction of dissident councilors seek strength in social policy - perhaps even to fully ally with their preferred faction. Although the consequences of such a factional alliance may be immense for the entire sector, a tentative supermajority between the remaining seperatists and Hegemony-leaning militarists ensure the Federation's navy has the budget to keep other factions at bay.",,,

Despite this, it maintains excellent - if self-endangering - combat pressure thanks to ludicrous antimatter-assisted boosters.

In the lull between the two AI wars, a leak of some highly confidential Federation documents detailed the extensive trials of a semi-refurbished Basilisk derelict. Though the original hull is presumed to have been scrapped, the secret about this brilliant red vessel has floated around the Holonet ever since. Seemingly made without the engineering techniques native to the Persean sector and the mainstay domain, the original craftsmanship is a crude form of high-tech. What few facts were learned about its origins still circulates the various networks with idle interest and theories following it, though it has been many cycles since the original discovery. Perhaps forgotten swaths of the Persean sector will reveal others of its kind?

fed_cruisercarrier,SHIP,"The venerable C1500-series ""Calvacade"" specializes in line-combat and decisive strikes with fighters and weapons alike. Being far more ubiquitious than other ""cruiser school"" hulls, the ship is well-armed and decently quick at full engine power. Notable features include an advanced communication array which enables rapid fighter maneuvers, a miniaturized accelerated ammo feeder system for coordinated gun strikes, and dedicated rescue shuttles that keep pilot losses to a minimum. While much beloved by its spacer crews, the cost of operation typically outclasses those of dedicated attack ships and support carriers.

Conversely, a Calvacade's pilots may experience a sense of unease when the advanced uplink unexpectedly disables their controls so the ""combat coordination"" computer can take over their fighters. While the computer-guided maneuvers allow for uncanny speeds and inhuman reactions, pilots often report discomfort from the intense g-forces and higher speeds. There is also a stigma around the computer's decision-making abilities, with the occasional pilot realizing the computer may coldly prioritize the survival of the wing over an individual fighter. Nonetheless, the high survival rate provided by the recovery shuttles typically mitigates any negative impact this rumor might have on fighter-jockey ranks.

Once tested with swappable logistical packages replacing the gun and lower hangar pontoons, Federation naval architects discovered the Calvacade's usefulness as a civilian hauler is hampered by the relative complexity and odd hullshape. The program was easily scrapped to make assets available for other projects, mostly because involved officers saw no need to change a well designed combat carrier.

Though entirely different from tachyon-based effects, the understanding of this weapon has been lost to time and hardware locks. Presumably developed to disable large civilian starships without causing lasting damage, the current model settings produce enough EM-flux to vaporize metal on contact. Nimble military-grade combatants can at least attempt to avoid the barrage altogether, and larger ships often have more resilience to systems failure.

The oddest aspect about this weapon is the effect on conscious biological targets. As discovered in unencrypted documentation in data files, a low power version of the weapon scoring a direct hit on a power armor user will place them into a coma-like state for up to 15 seconds. This knockout effect theoretically extends to any crew behind bulkheads, but the unfortunate locked-in supercharge means they're usually reduced them to ashes.",,,

This grants it the ability to deploy a fleet-protecting shield, even if the technology is fickle and not an outright replacement for normal shielding. Despite the benefits it brings in combat, the immense size of the hull is a challenge to maintenance crews and fleet coordinators alike.

Military strategists may scoff at the notion of using a freighter in combat, but the Perseverance was one of the few answers Federation planets had when the Domain attacked. They were also successfully employed in convoy missions, with their powerful guns dissuading all but the most foolhardy or well-equipped pirates.

The revered ""fleetships"" of the former Star Federation have become increasingly scarce since the Collapse, much like the notorious Rebellion-class battleships. The difference is that their rarity is not caused by stigmata, but because of the exorbitant expenses involved in deploying them. Perseverance-class fleetships of the current cycle are thus found most in drydocks, or more rarely in mission-critical convoys. Nevertheless, the presence of even one Perseverance--particularly when accompanied by a few escort vessels--is usually more than enough to fend off the most well-equipped interceptions.

Life on a Perseverance is often compared to civilian life, which is a welcome change of pace in the desolate reaches of the Persean fringe. While crew members still adhere to typical spacer practices like water and nutrient bar rations, the ship boasts a total of four bars, two holo-entertainemnt complexes, an exercise facility (complete with a real water swimming pool), and even hydroponics bays which provide a limited supply of fresh food.

Dubbed the ""Dodo"" by its spacer crew, the Hirondelle is indeed quite large and ungainly for a trans-atmospheric ship. This is largely due to the space required for its trooper complement, whose cramped and spartan living quarters can accommodate nearly a hundred (unhappy) marines and their suits.

After all, this vessel was surely reft from the minds of unfathomably intelligent AI cores, assuming such artefact were able to exist outside of the Domain's clutches.

Phase ships are rumored to be disturbing places for their crew and officers.

This brutal vessel is much more potent at standoff ranges than the mainline version, though at a marginal cost to its shield and flux systems. 

Though the war ended with the signing of the treaty, and these rebellious worlds collapsed without support, the havoc these distinctive vessels caused undoubtably left Scaria the only unruined Federation world. Like most traitor assets, these models were captured, evaluated, and then disposed of - usually discarded by dropping them into the crushing depths of a gas giant.

Rumors say there were proposed plans to make the Rebellion an even larger vessel. Proposedly split into three separate hulls, each with different power grids, this class of megaship would have likely demanded the attention of entire fleets. Unsurprisingly, the size of such a hull is assumed to be impossible with current technologies. And given the remarkable upkeep of existing Rebellion-class ships, it would likely be an impractical logistical burden, nevermind a strategically-unwieldy method of force projection.",,,

fed_hullbeam_med,WEAPON,"A fairly unimpressive anti-armor beam at a glance, the Hull Beam produces powerful ""particle spall"" explosions that ruin exposed hull.

Theoretical particle physicists imagine the effects of these ""hull beams"" originate from a quantum pairing effect between virtual particles in our spacetime and those of the infamous P-space dimension. The rapid oscillation of each other's phases between dimensions destabilizes, managing to produce twice the destructive effect when the particle stream is interrupted by a physical object. The charged nature of intruding particles means it is attracted to physical components, producing little hyperspace distortions that violently ionize pockets of gas located near energy sources.",Anti Armor,,
fed_hullbeam_large,WEAPON,"Though not an outstanding weapon if solely judged by the hard-numbers, the Hull Beam II's secondary cavitation and explosive effects can blow out the bulkheads of any exposed target.

fed_pikebeam,WEAPON,"The long accelerator rail and upscaled capacitors of the Pike allow it to pressure targets from afar. Somewhat underpowered versus shields and armor, but ideal for support vessels and light craft.

Essentially the same ""caliber"" as the Microbeam, the Pike's introduction came relatively quickly as Federation weapon design institutions struggled with new lens refinement and energy pump mechanisms. Though the ungainly particle chute greatly accelerated the stream, the effect of the beam impact remained oddly unchanged. While the silhouette is amusing at first glance, the maintenance process for re-aligning a distorted guidance pylon is no joke. ",Close Support,,
fed_minibeam,WEAPON,"A snub-nosed exotic particle beam with good range and punch. Nearly useless versus shields, but produces a destructive spalling effect on bare hull. 

Powered by a mysterious crystal substrate, the base-emitter of the Microbeam is grown from a fragment of crystal sample distributed across several forge facilities. Each beam shard is grown in conditions that could only be described as a ""stellar nursery"", an extremely hot but somewhat low-pressure atomic soup pulsed by radiation. Most crystals come out malformed, but a few can be extracted, milled down, and eventually fitted to the frame of a weapon.

A simple discharge can be achieved by cryogenically cooling a electrically charged crystal until it begins to violently dump its excess energy. The larger the core is, the longer it takes to discharge - but all produce a stream of exotic particles that violently self-obliterate anything not protected by a specifically calibrated magnetic field. Such short-lived and enigmatic things were seemingly difficult to study even before the Collapse, nevermind in the state of current Sector conditions.",Close Support,,

fed_legion,SHIP,"A vessel designed to perpetuate the Legion's long standing (and mostly well censored) service to the countless anti-Domain rebellions of old, the Star Federation Legion is a highly modernized ship compared to its predecessors. With the amount of design concessions required facilitate energy weapons and additional subsystems, it is unsurprising to learn it is more or less an entirely new ship built around the skeletal superstructure of a normal Legion. It is certainly a variant that might cause a spacer to glance over their scans twice. Perhaps three or four times if they serve under the Phoenix crest of the Hegemony.

While Hegemony leadership might argue whether or not the normal Legion's brutish burns conflict with its ability to provide long-range fire support, the Federation legion suffers a different problem. An energy centric-ship such as this would undoubtedly benefit from close range maneuvers, but cost and engineering concessions reduce the already ""thin"" armor of the Legion firmly into midline territory. The flux system also leaves much to be desired, given that most of the craft's volume is relegated to special technologies like missile-microforges and secondary shield infrastructure.

This relatively expensive and higher-maintenance pattern was likely used by new and affluent rebel worlds who, while far from Star Federation facilities, could use this Legion retrofit to put the Federation's technological innovations to work. How such a craft ended up in one of the hearts of the Star Federation's industrial bases is a mystery, but not an especially pressing one. ",,,
