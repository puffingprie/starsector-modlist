Codenamed ==Project Waking Ayreon==, this highly illegal craft is claimed - by Hegemony logs - to have simply fallen inert before maneuvering into battle. Official salvage reports claim its hulk was split in three parts and left to fall into the atmosphere of a gas giant. Apparently, the entire manifest of installed AI cores self-immolated into a radioactive slag.\nRecently, hyperwave buoys picked up disturbing inter-phasic fluxwaves triangulating from the very same system: ==$system==. A low resolution probe in system at the time caught a sillhouete in orbit around ==$location==: something which vaguely resembled the SFS Lost in Time, but with radically different emission profiles. That probe and all taskforces sent to approach the anomoly have failed to return since that image was taken, including a large fleet of several advanced Accordant-class battlecruisers.\nThe Star Federation now offers any operator a signifigant reward for the ==neutralization== of hyperwave source. Be advised: although the target is a single capital vessel, it should be approached by a ==large strike force==.",
