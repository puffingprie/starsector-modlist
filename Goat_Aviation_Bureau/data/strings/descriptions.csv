Goat_Aviation_Bureau,FACTION,"After a tortuous evacuation and difficult development, the Aviation Bureau finally settled in the periphery of the core worlds; restoring two ruined space stations to build up their strength. They don't know how far they can go, but the Aviation Bureau is confident that it will establish a foothold in the Sector.",,,
,,,,,
station_GAB11_suihen,CUSTOM,"A research station with a high-speed orbit. After Babel Station was reactivated, it was transformed into a defensive station in order to lessen overpopulation while also strengthening the system's defenses.",,,
station_GAB11_yuanjiang,CUSTOM,"A large space station that was built before the Collapse, but was forced to shut down as a result of it. It was not until the Aviation Bureau arrived in the Sector that simple maintenance was performed, restoring the station to operation. However, the Aviation Bureau underestimated the impact of exceeding the population limit by an order of magnitude: in under 50 cycles, the station's ecosystem was all but destroyed. The life support was so polluted it was nigh-unbreathable, with inhabitants requiring to wear respirators even in their sleep. The large ring of debris surrounding the station also became problematic due to becoming a safe haven for pirates and other extralegal activities. All this and more has forced the authorities to deport the population, barely keeping the station afloat at the cost of Mindscar Station's self-sufficiency. For better or worse, the Luddic Church has declared this state of being a ""divine punishment"": sparing the station from the risk of being destroyed by a Luddic warfleet.",,,

#Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
goat_CROWN,SHIP,"An incredibly versatile and powerful cruiser, the Luminary-class cruiser was intended as Saxton Shipyards' flagship design, capable of ruthlessly destroying fighters and warships alike. Thanks to its mighty reactor and efficient shields, it is a master of both offense and defense.

The design team in charge of developing this cruiser carried out an in-depth analysis of the Tidal Grid and graviton technologies to further optimize the cruiser's performance, allowing it to boast a state-of-the-art flux grid even by pre-Collapse standards, giving it impressive combat performance. With high speed as well as precision long-range weaponry, it is able to strike quickly and ensure victory: simultaneously, sufficiently redundant subsystems provide reliability and safety for the ship's crew.

The Brightcrown-class cruiser is undoubtedly a modern, high-quality ship that was the backbone of the Aviation Bureau's navy.
",,,
goat_TOWER,SHIP,"A highly capable and reliable battlefield bulwark. Its highly complex shield system, making extensive use of graviton technology, makes the Amore-class cruiser a nigh-invincible battlefield protector, with combat endurance and defense capabilities exceeding most capital ships.

Although this cruiser requires a great deal of tedious maneuvering to break away from the battlefield to dissipate its built-up flux, it has plenty of space available for modification to alleviate this issue. Saxton also reccomended that fleets should have a sufficient number of other ships to cover the Amore while it vents.

In addition to its powerful shields, the Amore posssesses a powerful set of defensive weapons capable of clearing out smaller targets by itself, making it less vulnerable to being caught alone. All of these traits make it a highly advanced and reliable ship, a master of defense with capable offense; an excellent choice for any fleet.",,,
goat_FLY,SHIP,"The Lightray-class destroyer was a collaborative effort by both Saxton Shipyards and the Goathead Aviation Bureau. A high-speed ship designed for surgical strikes, the two companies' proprietary techonologies grant it improved shields and engines, while also being outstanding performance in assault and pursuit with its diverse weapon layout.

A combination of Goathead's preference for high speed and firepowe with Saxton's doctrine of highly efficient heavy shielding, resulting in an all-purpose ship powerful in both attack and defense. Its flux grid is specially designed to provide sustained, powerful damage from its energy weapons. Its highly-tuned engines allow it to perform assault and pursuit at breakneck speed, making the Lightray very useful in a constantly-shifting battle.

In short, the Lightray-class destroyer is an efficient, powerful, reliable, and versatile ship using advanced technologies to earn it an important role in modern fleets, while reflecting Saxton Shipyards' philosophy of designing high-quality ships that are individually powerful.",,,
goat_DIRK,SHIP,"The Noon-class frigate is focused on drawing fire away from larger vessels, destroying other frigates, and responding to gaps in a battle line.

Efficient shields and polarized offer the Noon heavy defenses, allowing it to draw enemy fire away from other ships while still being able to provide fire support. And unlike some other offensive/defensive-focused frigates, it still possesses excellent maneuverability, allowing it to quickly break through hostile formations in order to draw fire while attacking them, in addition to the speedy capture of battlefield objectives.",,,
goat_THRONE,SHIP,"The Umbra-class cruiser is a top-of-the-line ship by the standards of the Sector, with mighty firepower and an aggressive flux grid, making it a considerable threat to even the largest targets.

Like other Saxton Shipyards designs, the Umbra was designed as a high-quality, powerful single ship: a cruiser designed for ruthlessly efficient firepower, its high speed and flexible loadout allows it to quickly adapt to changing battle situations while retaining a reasonable maintenance profile. Its advanced flux grid allows it to provide a constant stream of devastating firepower.",,,
goat_AWL,SHIP,"The Starlight-class frigate is a tiny carrier specializing in establishing air superiority, inhibiting enemy ships, and providing fire support.

Its design is focused on protracted battles: armed with a powerful fire control system and a large number of drones, the Starlight can strike at long range while providing fighter superiority.",,,
,,,,,
goat_evil_gaze,SHIP,This class of battleship dates back to the founding of the Aviation Bureau and has been in service even longer than the ancient Onslaught. Goathead's engineers have retrofitted her with a number of modernizations to get this behemoth of old to fire up its engines once more.,,,
goat_cagepot,SHIP,"A rugged troop carrier that provides efficient landing bays while transporting huge numbers of soldiers. Because of the removal of most superfluous facilities, the Cagepot-class has heavy armor, but captains who attempt to use it as a front-line ship will likely die when their marines rebel.",,,
goat_insulator,SHIP,"As a superior replacement for the Ox, the Whalestone-class carries a huge and sophisticated drive field stabilizer, which allows it to constrain a more compatible polygonal drive bubble, providing a more stable drive environment while dampening drive bubble agitation accordingly.

As a ship jointly developed by the Aviation Bureau and another corporation, it appears that a similar ship has also been released.",,,
goat_immortality,SHIP,"""The long-lived has passed away, but lives on as the undead."" The sizeable armaments and efficient shipboard system possessed by the Immortality-class allows it to easily crush anything before it, while integrating a large number of proprietary Aviation Bureau technologies with multiple iterations of armor ratios. All of this has given her an unassailable position in the Goathead doctrine and even when compared to battleships Sector-wide.

At the beginning of the Immortality's design, it was used as a bid against the Onslaught; and was redesigned after failing to prove itself superior. After re-adapting the Spiral Horn Device, reorganizing the weapon grid and introducing the dual-core system, the Immortality began to break away from the shadow of the Onslaught and became capable of ludicrous levels of firepower. To better serve this purpose, the designers completely abandoned the idea of efficient shields and maneuvering systems, making it a rugged, violent slaughterer.

It has been used by the Aviation Bureau to this day, and despite the production of more specialized or generalist ships, or the turmoil within and outside the Bureau, the Immortality remains a solid and reliable fleet anchor in the Bureau's fleet.",,,
goat_immortality_mod,SHIP,"""A silent wasteland filled with corpses."" The Desolation-class battleship inherits the same mighty firepower as its predecessor, and can quickly shred most ships with focused fire, but the removal of the Spiral Horns and a considerable amount of armor has resulted in considerably worsened flux statistics and durability, forcing it to rely on escorts.

While appearing to be a modification of the Immortality-class battleship, the Desolation was actually developed alongside that ship. Unlike the Immortality's focus on massive firepower, the Desolation was designed with one thing in mind: the market's need for a low-cost heavy warship. As a result, most of the ""unnecessary"" subsystems utilized by the former were omitted: even such core technologies as sub-composite armor and phase generators, greatly reducing the ship's maintenance requirements.

Despite this, the ship's designer Telfay-Deleph thought ahead and made sure that the Desolation retained adequate firepower and comprehensive redundant subsystems, so that the ship would not become excessively streamlined and thus rendered impractical to maintain, or vulnerable to some of the stronger ships it may face.


It has been used by the Aviation Bureau to this day, and despite the production of more specialized or generalist ships, or the turmoil within and outside the Bureau, its predecessor remains a solid and reliable fleet anchor, and the Desolation-class battleship continues to be a sturdy, reliable mainstay of the Bureau's fleets.",,,
goat_whorehouse,SHIP,"A huge combat carrier, the Infallible-class was the Aviation Bureau's earliest design, entering service when fighter-centric doctrine was on the rise. To this day, its fierce fighter deployment capabilities continue to prove that the sun has not yet set on it.",,,
goat_sword_power_smart_mind_of_aris_pro_supermax_NB01,SHIP,"The Blademaster-class battlecruiser is highly mobile and powerful, with a special hull configuration that grants it impressive tactical flexibility. Many fleet commanders favor using one as their flagship.

The Blademaster was created during the lead-up to the Aviation Bureau's fourth technological revolution, with clear ancestry to more streamlined hulls, and a combat style markedly different from older ships: with capacity for both heavy armament and heavy modification. But unsurprisingly, this once again came at the cost of defensive systems. While this makes the Blademaster falter when faced with other capital ships, it nonetheless tends to be much more oppressive on an enemy fleet than vice versa.",,,
,,,,,
goat_flowertide,SHIP,"The Flowertide is good at using its high speed to rush into the battlefield, destroying enemy ships, shattering young people's dreams of domination, and causing massive amounts of property damage; then retreating intact with its powerful tactical system. It is the unknown; making the fear of the unknown return to the world.

It was billed as the most stable high-speed cruiser in the sector, but during the prototype's liftoff, a sudden shutdown of her drive stabilizers caused it to crash into the dockyard, resulting in a major safety incident that killed up to 300 people. Subsequently, the designer, Telfay-Deleph, was executed for revealing secrets: but that didn't stop it from going into mass production. It was put into battle as a cheap and fast line ship.

There aren't many surviving Flowertides, but you can see them in some of the Bureau's elite fleets.
",,,
goat_Boxer,SHIP,"Brutal and destructive. As the prototype of the Dominator, the Ironfist-class was designed to use its high-speed burst of firepower to shred everything in its path. 

As a product of the same design period as the Dominator, the early Ironfist prototypes underwent several modifications and received a number of extremely radical design iterations. The result is a commercially available one that is somewhat different from the current Dominator. Also, these modifications made it far more expensive than the Dominator, which resulted in it not being loved by the Hegemony military.

Of course, that didn't stop it from being sold at Goathead's drydocks, because these stupid executives needed a warship that was fancy yet impractical...",,,
goat_midnight_book,SHIP,"The highly integrated frontal weapons array coupled with an overbuilt propulsion unit foreshadows this ship's high burst potential. With its high speed, it can easily roam the battlefield to take care of annoying flies or save expensive assets that are about to be wrecked.

Like its big brother, this extreme design is also the work of Telfay-Deleph: it's a relief to know that it has not had a single safety incident since the prototype's test flight.",,,
goat_midnight_tea,SHIP,"A more range-focused counterpart to the Nighttime Book, it fills the exact opposite role of its sibling, with powerful long-range support provided by its targeting matrix while maintaing a powerful drive system, allowing it to strike at any target, from any distance.

Like its big brother, this extreme design is also the work of Telfay-Deleph: it's a relief to know that it has not had a single safety incident since the prototype's test flight; in fact, this modified version has become synonymous with safety.",,,
goat_stringwind,SHIP,"The Windchime-class was chosen to be a more stable solution for long-haul shipping. It maximizes its fuel storage at the cost of nearly everything, whether it be armoring, engines, or weapons; but still has sufficient flexibility for the insatiable captain to modify it further.",,,
goat_ironpavilion,SHIP,"A tough and reliable carrier, based on an unmanned salvage ship design.",,,
goat_goatbone_scholar,SHIP,"""Today's lesson; DEATH!"" This mad cruiser was designed around the Spiral Horn Device. Extremely flux-efficient and devastating ordnance allow it to easily tear apart anything that makes the mistake of lingering in front of it.",,,
goat_forgotten_sun,SHIP,"This ship was originally in the process of being designed before the Collapse to provide a more heavily-armed alternative to the Dominator, but after its propulsion system was completed and the structural integrity was upgraded, the Collapse made it impossible for the designers to get further guidance: the Aviation Bureau had to complete this crazy sun-beast design by itself. This left it with a rather haphazard frontal armor loadout.",,,
goat_sails,SHIP,"An older model of ship, its heavily-automated design allows it to benefit from both strong armor and minimal crew requirements. As the most rugged and easy-to-maintain cruiser utilized by the Aviation Bureau, it is frequently used as a defensive escort in transport fleets.",,,
goat_hillshade,SHIP,"As an inaugural design of its design methodology, though it does not carry the iconic Induction Thrusters, its noteworthy armor levels and high cost effectiveness accurately portray the Aviation Bureau's new design philosophy. Furthermore, as one of the few dedicated carriers flying under the Goathead flag, the Shadowcast is often used to compensate for the lack of killing power in repeat engagements after a powerful attack.",,,
,,,,,
goat_spear_thrower,SHIP,"A competent standoff ship, yet a substandard destroyer. The atrocious speed of the Spearsmith makes it to struggle to catch up even with some cruisers, which made it almost impossible to engage in pursuit. But its oversized long-range armament ensured its defensive dominance.

Many captains see it as a piece of junk; just as many call it as priceless. The price of this ship fluctuated so much that many factories did not want to produce it.

""It was probably a bad night, a bad time, a bad person, with a bad idea, a bad drawing, a bad beer. An absolutely awesome result was created."" -------- blueprint header note",,,
goat_machete,SHIP,"The Decapitator-class is quite flexible. A large number of missile mounts allow it to achieve rather ridiculous bursts of damage, and a built-in autofactory that can happily solve the endurance problem, making it a perfect ship!

The designer, Telfay-Deleph, was proud to say that this ship would appear in the Goathead fleet in large numbers. And as it turned out later... she was wrong.
",,,
goat_gentiles,SHIP,"""Charge, charge, and charge again!"" As a ship designed for charging, it carries internal pressurized engine nozzles and a hardened armor configuration that makes it the most valiant warrior on the battlefield.",,,
goat_rainfarewell,SHIP,"A battlefield ranger with a moderate weapon configuration makes this hull a mobile escort. This gives it the ability to traverse the entire battlefield to provide adequate reinforcements to weak positions, or to deliver swift strikes against high-risk enemies.",,,
goat_fastboxer,SHIP,"A unique and beautiful design. Like a boxer, this ship forgoes protection in order to focus exclusively on attack: gaining high speed and massive missile firepower. In order to prevent loss of air superiority, it had the infamous Flare Fortress system installed, turning it into a ""sparkling"" missile platform.

Rumors in the area that the bridge of the ship resembled some kind of genital organ led to the Dragonfist becoming a major point of criticism against its designer, Telfay-Deleph, for their bizarre cult-like reverence for reproduction.",,,
goat_forgotten,SHIP,"The Settler-class, a reliable salvage ship. While still containing many civilian subsystems after its militarization, its versatile repair gantry was removed and adjusted to a large energy mount. Nowadays, it's capable as both a salvage vessel, and as a support ship during combat.",,,
goat_birdwatching,SHIP,"Its massive Artichoke missile launchers make it quite notable: indeed, its missile output is very impressive for its size.",,,
goat_rhizome,SHIP,"A tug comparable to the Ox, but also capable of mining operations.",,,
goat_whiteone,SHIP,"The Goatbell-class destroyer is perhaps best described as a massive ammo feeder. Like the Autumn, its firepower gives it the ability to very quickly destroy ships in the same class or lower, its TPC shots ringing out like a bell on a frenzied goat.",,,
,,,,,
goat_pathogenic_wind,SHIP,"It has a rather peculiar design, which led to off-kilter combat and high maintenance costs.

By the time it was officially launched, the strange design tendencies raised many questions and led to its sales being seriously lower than expected; but fortunately the production chief quickly introduced a new generation of warships: the Tempest-class, which recovered some of the lost profits.

Until recently, the Tempest underwent one innovation after another, and eventually the technical property rights were acquired. Goathead Aviation Bureau could only restart this old production line and urgently add some drones to ensure the competitiveness of the frigate industry.

As of now, the Illwind is more common in the market compared to the Tempest, as it is simply produced too much.",,,
goat_arson_bird,SHIP,"""The bird of fire sends a message of death."" A semi-civilian design utilized by the Aviation Bureau, the Phoenix-class usually serves as a scout in transport fleets, or deployed en masse for fire support. Minimal crew requirements and low cost makes fleet commanders feel no regret sending them to their deaths; needless to say, the crews don't exactly agree.

The ship's bridge is mostly occupied by a massive AI control system with a bulky external radiator: in order to comply with Domain regulations, this system must still be manned by at least three humans at any given time.

Its aggressive weapons layout in spite of its relatively limited flux grid, combined with its violent systems, dictates that the Phoenix is only capable of supporting short bursts of high firepower, and once it exceeds its limits, the Phoenix will predictably transform into a pile of ash - just as its name suggests.",,,
goat_fliegender_stern,SHIP,"""A fiery nova crosses the battlefield."" As a distinctive raid ship, the heavy and complex multi-layer ablative armor provides it with some of the best survivability in its class.

The expertly-designed, powerful powertrain that the Shootingstar-class possesses allows it to make rapid course corrections with excellent strategic maneuverability, making it effective in both support and raid roles. Thanks to these advantages, the Shootingstar is an indispensable backbone of the Bureau's small and medium fleets.

However, it should be noted that the firepower of the Starflyer is relatively weak and should be supplemented by fire support ships to be more effective in standoff battles.",,,
goat_harebell,SHIP,"""A flower that accompanies a deadly warship."" The Bluebell-class frigate was designed as an escort: its long range and powerful flux grid allows it to provide close-range fire support against ships of any size when paired with other ships.",,,
goat_stormlight,SHIP,"""The destructive light of a storm."" This insanely designed ship plays with time while destroying its enemies.",,,
goat_warhook,SHIP,"""A killer in the shadows, a hunting hook serving Death."" Constellation-class frigates work best alongside stronger and more durable attack ships, to deliver destruction to all ships that dare to think their shields are strong.",,,
goat_shutter,SHIP,"Known in the sector as the ""Silent Shadow"", this ship proves such a nickname is not hyperbole. Unlike its sister ship, the Windlantern, the Shadow Wraith is more inclined to execute its enemies in a flash. Its first-class missile output allows it to extinguish enemy ships in a matter of seconds.",,,
goat_ferrysnow,SHIP,"A super-fast ship known for its high maneuverability. Its combat speed is comparable to that of an average fighter, giving it excellent combat ability versus other frigates and the ability to quickly carry out orders. The violent look of its propulsion sometimes leads to it being mistaken for a comet.

In order to activate the overpressure jets, it requires the whole crew to strap themselves in and disables the gravity generators. This tendency to make its crews prisoners in their own ship has earned it an infamous nickname: the ""Styx Crossing"".",,,
goat_redaugust,SHIP,"Based on the Brawler, this ship focuses on solid armor as its defense as opposed to the original version's mobility focus, giving it a role in the Aviation Bureau's fleets as a stalwart during light skirmishes.",,,
goat_arson_bird_x,SHIP,"As the smallest freighter utilized by the Aviation Bureau, the Butcherbird-class frigate focuses on ensuring its cargo is delivered safely. Multi-layer armor and bursts of firepower make it an annoyingly difficult target for pirates, while the relatively large cargo bays allow it to still perform quite well as a freighter. ",,,
goat_arson_bird_h,SHIP,"The ship most emblematic of the Aviation Bureau's design philosophy, designed by the company's founder, the Hurdle was updated many times over the course of the company's existence, resulting in a powerful scout vessel.",,,
,,,,,
goat_AI_ship,SHIP,"A ship both designed and largely controlled by artificial intelligence: with a powerful flux grid, high modularity, and advanced fire control, this ship truly is savage in the ruthless destruction of its enemies.

When the Sprouting Dockyards were acquired by the Aviation Bureau, there was no real exchange of research information: a lot of the Dockyards' proprietary technologies remained classified. This made their ship models increasingly difficult to maintain after the Collapse due to a lack of information, ultimately leading to most of the aforementioned technologies being abandoned, with only the relatively simple ships remaining in production. As one of those relatively mundane ships, the Savage-class destroyer was officially put into production after a simple ""chip-hack"".",,,
goat_AI_ship_s,SHIP,"A ship both designed and largely controlled by artificial intelligence, with a surprisingly hull structure. Compared to its more reserved counterpart, the Mangler-class destroyer focuses more on speed and firepower, making it better suited to performing strikes against isolated targets or using its mobility to quickly achieve battlefield objectives.

all_goat_giant_halberd_l,WEAPON,"This large launcher is a veritable death machine; firing superheavy Megahalberd torpedoes, it can demolish even the heaviest armor with ease.

The fracture warhead that was mounted on had to be fitted with a protective casing because it was too unstable. The overflow energy of the warhead also led to the instant collapse of any guidance mechanism, and even its thrusters could only use the form of collected energy from the warhead to propel the projectile. All of this was unreasonable, in exchange for an extremely powerful one-shot kill.
