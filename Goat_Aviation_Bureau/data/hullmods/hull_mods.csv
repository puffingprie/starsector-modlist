Engineers were unable to explain this phenomenon, resulting in it becoming a black-box device with a very uncooperative mode of operation.

This device always attempts to ""ascend"": it constantly tries to raise the dimensional state of both itself, and all entities connected to it; and is then stopped by the built-in inhibitor. Since there is no engineer who can understand its blueprint, it is impossible to tell if such behavior is normal.

Its behavior is not all bad; the tendency to raise the dimension makes radiation near the ship become turbulent, which succeeds in helping the ship conceal itself. The ship's sensor profile is reduced by %s.
