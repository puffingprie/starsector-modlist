astroidships_boulder,SHIP,The boulder is a Frigate designed by pirates as a very cheap and easy way to have a simple ship used for basic missile suppression and is noted for being made out of random asteroids that float around the universe.,,,
astroidships_stoner,SHIP,The Stoner is a basic Frigate artillery platform built by mashing some asteroids and floating satellite pieces together. It rarely works the way pirates expect it to.,,,
astroidships_havel,SHIP,The Havel is what happens when pirates decide that there needs to be more firepower coming from their captured asteroids. The Havel is the most powerful of the frigate sized asteroidships and sould not be underestimated.,,,
astroidships_vesta,SHIP,The Vesta is an artillery platform made by pirates by taking larger astroids out of asteroid belts throughout the sector. These ships are very well suited for combat dispite being out of asteroids.,,,
astroidships_tholen,SHIP,"Seeing the need for better firing arcs for their asteroid destroyers the pirates created the Tholen to better deal with enemy missile attacks. These ships are usually found backing up other ships but do not have the firepower to take on most ships of it's size very well,",,,
astroidships_galileo,SHIP,The Galileo is a support vessel the pirates made after deciding that the stoner wasn't good enough and created a destroyer version of the same concept. This ship has the potential to be a formidable ship with the right loadout and captain but rarely ever is.,,,
astroidships_rock,SHIP,The Rock is a Light Cruiser created by the pirates for simple suppression of enemy ships. It barely counts as a cruiser as nearly every non civilian cruiser will almost always beat it in combat.,,,
astroidships_cerus,SHIP,As the pirates continue to learn about construction with asteroids it was only time before they made a proper combat capable Cruiser. The Cerus is(aside from the Pebble) the most powerful of the astroidships and should be considered an actual threat not much different than a Dominator but with much less armour as it mostly made from astroid materials.,,,
astroidships_clanker,SHIP,The Clanker is a raiding Cruiser built with speed and hit and run tactics in mind. It may not have the straight up firepower that the Cerus has but don't let that deceive you into thinking this ship will be an easier fight.,,,
astroidships_pebble,SHIP,The Pebble is the ultimate end all of ship construction using asteroids and as well as being made from them this ship is also known to have a shield created from a blueprint of the Paragon that was taken during a daring raid on the Port Tse Franchise Station #3 held by the Tri-Tachyon. This ship is easily one of the most powerful ships the pirates have access to.,,,
astroidships_orisis,SHIP,A very simple fighter made from fragments of asteroids. It is only slightly worse than a talon.,,,
astroidships_mentis,SHIP,"A simple and cheap carrier designed with the basic idea of allowing the pirates to field a carrier without having to use either the Condor or the Collossus MKIII, both of which are converted ships whereas the Mentis is more purpose built for the role, although there is still many a debate within pirate circules weather the Mentis's cheaper cost is worth not having the Condors missile mount.",,,
astroidships_kari,SHIP,"So what happens to the shipping containers of a Atlas when it gets converted to a MKII? Well, you get the Kari. Nothing more than some containers straped to some engines and a forward gun platform made of asteroids this ship is an okay addition to any fleet that wishes have a fairly cheap Combat Freighter as part of their defence force against Pirates or any other hostiles while traveling through the sector.",,,
astroidships_pasithee,SHIP,"A Combat Tanker that is literally just a section of a large asteroid connected to the the side of a Phaeton. This ship, while not very combat effective does at least allow a fleet wielding it to take their tanker into combat to defend itself instead of the usual case of having to flee with the rest of the civilian ships.",,,
astroidships_fenrir,SHIP,A newly created Capital Ship that exists for the Pirates to try and have a Battle Carrier for themselves. Unfortunally due the space taken up by the fighter bays and the fuel tanks this ship is incapable of housing a decent complement of aircraft and weapons without sacrificing flux and/or hull modifications. Nonetheless this ship is still a very capable warship and should not be taken lightly by anyone facing it.,,,
