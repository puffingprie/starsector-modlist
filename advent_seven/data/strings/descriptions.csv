#SHIPS,,,,,
tarantula7s,SHIP,"Following the conclusion of the Second AI War, the Persean League aimed to attain a more decisive victory against smaller ship classes, and to that end developed the Tarantula. The Tarantula is a ship equipped with an aggressive propulsion system that allows it to rapidly close in on enemies by diverting power from the shields to all other aspects, including the active aspect of it's armor, it's weaponry, and most importantly it's main engine for a massive forward boost. While the Tarantula is extremely effective at pursuing and killing smaller ships, the limited range of it's weaponry, coupled with the lack of firepower compared to other ships of it's size means that it is ineffective against equally sized or larger foes.",,,
elipsion7s,SHIP,"Facing significant financial losses following the events of the Battle of Forlorn Hope, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation standardized some aspects of their fleet composition to reduce running costs. To that end, the Elipsion class destroyer was developed, possessing a modular core that allows it to assume different roles in battle, with each core type wildly changing it's battlefield performance compared to others, albeit at the cost of friendly battlefield interference resulting in lower numbers being actually deployable.",,,
hound7s,SHIP,"A largely remade variant of the original Hound, this version boasts better armor, an improved flux grid, a small hangar for Talon LPCs, and a canister flak system, turning it from a freighter which happens to have heavy weaponry, to an actual dedicated combat vessel. Hound class combat freighters are very common vessels in the Persean Sector, so much so that eventually a militarized variant was demanded, and thus created.",,,
wayfarer7s,SHIP,"A redesigned hull taking after the Wayfarer's core, focusing on greater firepower and mobility with a focus on missile weaponry. Due to the rise in aggressive activities in the sector after the instability generated by the AI wars, traders demanded more militarized Wayfarers due to their comparatively high survivability and versatility compared to other freighters.",,,
trampler7s,SHIP,"With the considerable success that the Retribution and Eradicator classes were obtaining in varied combat scenarios, a new concept was made in an attempt to merge their qualities in one ship.  Trampler class cruiser was the chosen design behind that idea design,  with an aggressive loadout, which focuses on faster repositioning, while also being able to hold points of interest against smaller classes, or even lighter cruisers. Although, it cannot secure front lines in fleet engagements, and its point defense is not enough to defend itself against heavier swarms of missiles and fighters unless it dedicates its large turret to do so.",,,
Stella_Tempestas7s,SHIP,"Among the stars, in the fringes of the Persean Sector, machinations of Tri-Tachyon Defense Systemâ€™s Remnants, resulted in assembly of a beast with unimaginable power, capable of holding the marvels of shipment military forces. The aegis of shielding, the pilum of phase cloak, makes this ship capable of enduring waves of attacks while being a menace to any enemy's subsystems and antimatter drives, exposing them to further attacks. Like a jack of all trades, master of none, just a skilled captain can properly use such abilities to show the claws of this vessel.",Unidentified Vessel,01001101 01100101 01110010 01100111 01100001 00100000 01010111 01110010 01100001 01101001 01110100 01101000,
Afflictor7s,SHIP,"A dangerous and swift phase frigate with a weapons loadout powerful enough to bring down much heavier ships. This variant had its phase coil removed, and replaced by a device, which makes the ship seemingly use entropy for protection, and acquired extra engines for a powerful plasma jets system",,,
Doom7s,SHIP,"Designed when phase technology was generally unknown and phase detectors were not a standard of every sensor package, this cruiser has lost the advantage of surprise - but retains a dangerous and flexible weapons loadout. This variant had its phase coils removed and replaced by a perilous phase attractor, which can be brutal for enemy phase ships, as well as being tricky to deal with for standard vessels, since it can pull enemies towards itself, even if they are phased.",,,
Vespa7s,SHIP,"After Brawler class frigates showed inefficiency against pirate raids using Condor and Colossus carriers with Talon LPCs, an urgent demand for anti-fighter frigates manifested, which resulted in creation of Vespa-class frigate. Combining aspects from Wasp drones in a frigate chassis, this vessel accommodates some features, that can make any carrier officer die from fear and some weaponry to take down weaker enemies. However, anything that goes past its shield generator can and will be it's demise, and maintenance of this ship can put a strain on some minor fleets.",,,

#FIGHTERS,,,,,
automated_talon7s,SHIP,"The Talon fighter has undergone a conversion into a drone, rendering it both crewless and cost-effective. Created to assist Hound (M) class frigates, it maintains its good firepower and speed, with enhanced targeting efficiency. However, these modifications have resulted in a decrease in its optimal engagement distance.",,,

#SHIP_SYSTEMS,,,,,
,,,,,
interceptburn7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,,Offensive,"Propels the vessel forwards, disabling shields, but halving all damage received, while increasing damage dealt by ballistic weaponry depending on hardflux levels, up to double at full hardflux",
fortressshield7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Redirects all power from the weapon systems to shields, greatly increasing the efficiency at which damage is absorbed. This process generates hard flux at a steady rate even if the shields are not taking any fire.",Defensive,"Reduces the damage taken by shields to a minimum, but generates hard flux while active.",
fluxdrive7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,,Defensive/Offensive,"Reboots disabled weapons and engines while granting zero flux boost (ZFB). If conditions to enable ZFB are achieved, generates a damper field that halves the damage received on hull and armor.",
tempestas_cloak7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,,Defensive/Offensive,"Moves the ship into an alternate dimension where time passes more quickly. Ship can not be hit by any weapons and dissipates partial flux per deactivation.

Builds up hardflux while used, and only remains active for a short period. Cannot remain active at 40% or more hardflux level or by being too close to enemy cruisers and capital ships.",
entropy_damper7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly activates an entropy-dampening field that reduces all damage taken, all flux generated, and rapidly repairs all disabled engines and weapons. Repairs a small portion of armor per use.",Defensive,"Briefly activates an entropy-dampening field that halves all damage taken and all flux generated, and rapidly repairs all disabled engines and weapons. Disables shields.",
phase_attractor7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Creates a phase field around this vessel and the target, attracting it with considerable force. It can also attract phased ships.",,,
entropy_field7s,SHIP_SYSTEM,,,"Surrounds the vessel in a dense fog, that interferes with enemy fighters' engines, dealing damage over time and causing full flameouts. Does not affect missiles",

#GUNS,,"I gotta, you need them",,,
Repulser7s,WEAPON,"An antiquate weapon, that fires ionized antimatter in the form of unstable projectiles, which repulse targets away with a considerable force. Due to its nature, it is almost useless against other ships, since most of the projectiles don't reach the maximum range, and the damage output is not that impressive",,,
Slagga7s,WEAPON,"Commonly known as Slagger, or ""Slagga!"" to outlaws, this weapon utilizes left out molten waste from ore refineries, putting them within heat resistant shells, that usually upon being shot, crack, spewing out slag into space, as well as onto it's target, making the hull heat up, then drastically quickly cool down, the armour becoming easier to break further.",,,
Mortar_layer7s,WEAPON,"A conversion of the ubiquitous Heavy Mortar weapon into a reliable point defense suitable for hardpoint slots. Fires a barrage of projectiles with a respectable blast radius and fuse range, capable of destroying swarms of missiles and fighters. Although, it requires a considerable time to reload and unlike conventional point defense weapons, it cannot turn around.",,,
Plasma_accelerator7s,WEAPON,"A weapon capable of concentrating high amounts of energy and dispersing them at high velocity, using a beam projector as a slipstream to release a devastating pulse. Although powerful, it cannot reach farther ranges than normally other beam weapons can achieve and does not have a continuous fire rate like other projectile-based weapons.",,,
Electric_dispenser7s,WEAPON,"A simple weapon that is capable of firing EMP arcs, that are extremely effective as missile disablers. Does not have damage output to disable fighters or do relevant damage to other targets.",,,

Wati_description,CUSTOM,"Anomalous p-space readings shine from this planet's orbit, as if several phase coils have been turned on at once. Your Tripad registers this planet as Wati, but lacks any other information about it, even with the fact that this stellar entity looks like an irradiated world.",,,
nexus7s_description,CUSTOM,"This massive triangular-shaped station was strangely overhauled to be a center of operations of a certain kind. Such structure strikes fear upon your crew, but it may be useful for hosting some fleet operations.",,,
star_green7s,PLANET,"A G3-B type primary sequence star, estimated age is three to four billion years. Measured temperature is about seven thousand degrees, while core temperature could well exceed eight million degrees. This rare color is resulted by a electromagnetic radiation frequency of 546 nanometers, which is higher then a blue star, and lower then a yellow star.",,,
