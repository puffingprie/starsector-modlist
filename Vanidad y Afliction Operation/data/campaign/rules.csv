Clustered around the edges of the room, natives of Kristos in their signature habsuits quietly drink and whisper to each other around softly glowing, rotating orange orbs. At tables placed around the bar, spacers regale each other with stories over pale, flat beer. At the bar itself, loud, overdressed men and women in blue-accented Hegemony military uniforms drink what appear to be expensive drinks.

Wading through the strange, segregated atmosphere of the bar, you find an empty booth and take a seat.",,
