### Stjärngård ################,,,,,,
prv_stjarngard_strand,CUSTOM,"Great waves of harmless golden sand punctuated by a occasional streams, lakes and even a few minor oceans make up the main geographical features on Strand. Sadly, the otherwise pleasant planet is completely bereft of valuable resources or significant soil nutrients and the population must make a living though trade and manufacturing.",,"While economically completely worthless - its main export would be silicate - the low gravity and almost comforting biosphere of Strand make it an ideal waystation for goods that would be expensive and difficult to process elsewhere. The prv Starworks Corporation have set up a major presence here, completely dominating local politics through a combination of gunboat diplomacy and monopolizing all spacebound logistics on the planet.",,
prv_stjarngard_strand_station,CUSTOM,"Perseiska Kompaniet is a vast prv trade house that considers Strand its private protectorate. They control the majority of all trade on the colony, and impose military protection in exchange for extortionate fees. Nothing gets done on Strand without Kompaniet getting its cut of the proceeds.",,"Luxuriously decorated, the lavish halls of the PK speak of great wealth, or possibly great insecurity. With all the good taste of a bank office and humility of an aristocrat’s mansion, the station’s environments are considered entirely insufferable by anyone not a Tri-Tachyon financier or prv noble. All in all it is the perfect place to exchange large sums of other people’s money.",,
prv_stjarngard_utbo,CUSTOM,"A large, mild eccentric world populated by millions of people who live quiet lives mainly as farmers under the thumb of a dizzying array of feudal lords. All legal trade with the world passes through the orbital station, leaving the planet itself largely isolated from the sector.",,"Time passes slowly in endless farmsteads, fishing villages and townships of Utbo. The farmers work the land, the lords skirmish amongst each other, and the corporation taxes. In the planetside port, a large armed garrison ensures that no visitors leave the trade city without a passport, and likewise that no unauthorized locals enter it.",,
prv_stjarngard_utbo_station,CUSTOM,"Hanging as a dark star in the sky above the night-side of Utbo the orbital smelters, foundries and yards that form the industrial heart of the system loom hungrily, always asking for additional dues from the lords on the planet below.",,"The outer walls of the station contain a complex of dirty smelters, busy yards, noisy manufactories and bustling trade docks, all overlooked by a series of gigantic towers looming through the central axis of the station. In the towers residential sections are squeezed in between formal corporate offices and opulent trade houses. 

Salarymen walk the skybridges between the towers and cargo barges weave through the thin air and low gravity, delivering goods to wherever they are needed. Underneath the towers monorail trains move the industry laborers about through the din and clamor of the wharves and workshops. 

In the towers, ever-busy bureaucrats hurry through sedate parks and solemn office houses, while on the ring calm, collected workers carefully navigate a cacaphonous bustle of men and machines.",,
prv_stjarngard_utbo_moon1,CUSTOM,"Barren, lifeless, and one of two reasons for the fascinating tidal patterns on Utbo, this dead rock has little else to offer the universe at large.",,,,
prv_stjarngard_utbo_moon2,CUSTOM,"Barren, lifeless, and one of two reasons for the amazingly intricate folk astrology of the peasants on Utbo, this dead rock has little else to offer the universe at large.",,,,
prv_stjarngard_ymer,CUSTOM,A giant planet composed primarily of a mist of frozen water overlaying gigantic icebergs floating in a diffuse sea of liquid nitrogen.,,,,
prv_stjarngard_ymer_moon1,CUSTOM,"Hot, fiery and always changing the moon of Ny offers great wealth to the mining crews who work on it. It's hard, dangerous work but the reward is well worth it - at least for the managers who sit in their climate-controlled offices at the colony hub. Order and discipline is maintained through a large gendarmerie of comfortably employed guards.",,"Nothing on Ny lasts for very long. The acrid atmosphere, intense earthquakes, and rapid tectonic movements ensure that no industrial installation can remain for more than a cycle or two. The men who work the mines can, with some luck, last longer. Some even manage to save enough of their wages to leave.",,
prv_stjarngard_ymer_moon2,CUSTOM,"Icy, cold and full of fascinating gasses locked under the ice, Nedan has reserves of volatiles that are expected to last for hundreds of cycles. The workers on the planet labor diligently to pump up anything of value from the crushing depths of the abyssal sea, where freezing temperatures and immense pressure combine to offer incredibly challenging working conditions.",,"The volatiles industry of Nedan stretches its pipelines over the vast ice plains of the moon like veins, delivering the lifeblood of interstellar travel to the spaceport and only permanent settlement.

On the barely-prepared icy plain that serves as the planet spaceport severe men wearing fur-lined clothes and breathing masks dourly receive any travelers, who are waved towards the main port structure, barely visible through the snow haze. It is a lonely place, empty offices and empty spaces on an empty planet. Outside, the wind screeches and the whirling snow claims another few meters of visibility.",,
prv_stjarngard_bov,CUSTOM,"This rogue rock hurtles through space on a distant and irregular orbit, keeping itself and its twin Bandit a constant annoyance for astronavigators in the system.",,,,
prv_stjarngard_bandit,CUSTOM,A dust-covered ball of regolith hurtling through space on a moody and unpredictable path that has shepherded an asteroid field into a stable orbit in the inner system.,,,,

### Kylan ####################,,,,,,
prv_kylan_tordehus,CUSTOM,"Once a pearl of the Domain, this world was lost to surface bombardment during the collapse. Only in recent decades has anything approaching civilization started to return to the now-sealed habitats scattered amongst the ruins. Named for the current warlord in charge, Tord.",,"Disjointed networks of crudely sealed-up buildings criss-cross this world, proving that life goes on even after the apocalypse. Scavenge teams, techminers, bandits and raiders in sealed exosuits scurry between the gigantic once-homes of a lost society while the people of the larger resettlements work in their sealed habitats to ensure that their waterworks, powerplants and greenhouses stay functional.",,
prv_kylan_tordehus_station,CUSTOM,The shattered remains of what was once a welcoming portal to a thriving world. Jagged holes in the structure of this station offer solemn testimony about the fate of its inhabitants.,,"A visitor walking through the remains of the trade quarter would not even hear his footsteps echo, due to the lack of air. Long since picked clean of anything of value nothing remains here but desolation.",,
prv_kylan_ryak,CUSTOM,"A swirling mass of ionized gasses and strange energies, Ryak is an astronomical marvel that has fascinated scientists for hundreds of years. Constantly churning and rearranging its own mass and bombarded by the ceaseless energies of Kylan, few places in the sector can provide as much insight into the finer details of the EM spectrum as this incandescent gas giant.",,,,
prv_kylan_ryak_station_prv,CUSTOM,"Built to study the roiling magnetosphere of the gas giant below the HEL has been a roaring success, providing the sector with all manner of advanced technology both before and after the collapse. In later years, the laboratory station has had annexes added for volatiles capture and light industrial manufacturing.",,"Business is booming at the HEL, where old laboratories are now complemented by a volatiles siphon, manufacturing facilities and a permanent military base. Frazzled scientists and busy technicians pass through the corridors of the station on unnamed errands while armed guards escort merchants and their shipments directly to their individual destinations.",,
prv_kylan_ryak_station_tt,CUSTOM,"Built to study the roiling magnetosphere of the gas giant below the HEL has been a roaring success, providing the sector with all manner of advanced technology both before and after the collapse. In later years, the laboratory station has had annexes added for volatiles capture and light industrial manufacturing.",,"Business is booming at the HEL, where old laboratories are now complemented by a volatiles siphon, manufacturing facilities and a permanent military base. Frazzled scientists and busy technicians pass through the corridors of the station on unnamed errands while sharply dressed executives direct traders and their shipments directly to their individual destinations.",,
prv_kylan_fjarran_store,CUSTOM,"Exiles and bandits from Tordehus gather up at Store's Rock, generally to prey on trade heading through the Ryak High-Energy Labs. A small mining installation supports what passes for an economy on this transient world.",,"Originally a mining installation, the old staff buildings have mostly been taken over by pirates and smugglers, who quickly converted the settlement to house twice as many now-free spirits. Old hands run crowded bars and haphazard shipyards while a constant flow of newcomers from Tordehus sign up with more or less reckless captains to do more or less legal things.",,
,,,,,,
### Kratul ####################,,,,,,
prv_kratul_fristad,CUSTOM,"A quiet frontier world with a population that's not at all interested in the greater problems of the sector, or even the local system. The Church of Galactic Redemption is highly influential on the planet, but have not yet managed to convince the populace to officially join Ludd's flock.",,"Visitors to the Fristad spaceport are greeted by two large tripedal skeletons with remarkably pointy teeth exhibited in the main hall, a poignant reminder that the local biohazard protocols are no joke. While most of the biosphere is benign and quite literally spineless, a few species of apex predators are more than capable of claiming unwary humans. A stall next to one of the specimens has a corporate suit selling dead peasants insurance to visiting captains, should any crew go missing during their stay. Realistically, the spacers’ bars claim significantly more lives - and the insurance covers that as well.",,
prv_kratul_rust_station,CUSTOM,"The largest mining station in the Kratul system, claimed sovereign by the miners and spacers who live and work there. An anarchic order is maintained by the local community militia, who generally end up sympathetic to the great man of the hour.",,"During the Domain the Kratul system was used as a scrapyard for ship hulks deemed to be of marginal economic interest. Over the centuries the salvage stocks built up, orbits decayed, and the whole mess got mixed into the asteroid belts of the system. Post-collapse, miners and salvagers make a good living recovering what, these days, are often regarded as perfectly good ships that just need some basic refurbishment.",,
prv_kratul_oy_station,CUSTOM,"Intended to supplement the Kratul II wharfs, the Outer Yards were a grandiose project meant to supply much of the demand for civilian ships in the ever-growing Persean sector. However the station was only halfway constructed at the time of the collapse, and today it sits still unfinished, sporting jutting support beams and abandoned construction equipment.",,"An ever-growing population of traders, miners and engineers live and work on the Outer Yard, making their livings off the generous amounts minerals and salvage brought back from the belt. Local society is largely syndicalist and basic law and order is maintained by a system of guild enforcers with each policing its own quarter of the station. Inter-syndicate conflicts are common, and often get inflamed but only rarely escalate into organized violence. Still, visitors are advised to not ask about the c194 incidents.",,
prv_kratul_kratul,CUSTOM,"The very face of industrial devastation, Kratul II's rimy and mountainous surface sports dozens of different types of ice - most highly toxic. An extensive mining industry and countless heavy manufactories have polluted freely over centuries and while the planet was never terribly habitable to begin with the post-collapse years have brought the environment to a point where walking the surface unprotected is regarded as, at best, unwise.",,"A popular pastime on Kratul is snipe-hunting. In this case, the snipe is an actual animal that lives and feeds on various chemical ices, metabolizing even the strangest toxins. Supposedly the species was bioengineered by a local potentate, who missed the post-burn hunts of his youth on Jangala. Reportedly the snipe is very difficult prey - quick, clever, and so tough that ”it doesn't die even if you kill it”.",,
prv_kratul_kratul_station,CUSTOM,"One of the largest and oldest spacewharfs in the Persean Sector. In the pre-collapse era it was to be one of the primary manufacturing locations for Skymning-class battleships, a large number of which have been laid down and then left to rust unfinished at anchorpoints slowly orbiting the station.",,"When the light is just right a visitor can look out one of the station's massive panorama windows and see the dozens of battleship hulls anchored around the wharf. Massive ribcages of beasts that never were, an armada that even the Domain thought excessive. And a very attentive visitor could even notice the occasional flicker of light or moving shadow among the skeletal behemoths, as work slowly progresses on one of the hulks.",,
prv_kratul_basen_station,CUSTOM,An old mining outpost unmoored from its original position and towed to beyond the reach of local authorities. Now used as a staging post by pirates who find the loose rules of Ruster society to be overly confining.,,"Little more than a refueling post, Basen offers only the basest creature comforts and frequently doesn't even have any fuel for sale. The miserly station only livens up when successful raiders come along to spend their ill-earned loot.",,

### Hallar ####################,,,,,,
prv_hallar_station,CUSTOM,"A terraforming hub, commercial dockyard and seat of the prv merchant house Mångtekniska Regalvarven, Höga Hallar found no end of misfortune, it’s terraforming efforts failing after the loss of the gate network, and its mercantile ambitions crushed by merciless AI fleets.",,"You walk through the abandoned station, where a trickle of emergency power still displays evacuation instructions on viewscreens, pondering the endless ambition of the Domain. The station remains in good order, albeit lacking anything of any particular use or value. An empty container, with only a record of what is now missing.",,
prv_hallar_planet,CUSTOM,"The failure of the terraforming hub at Höga Hallar has had disastrous effects on the oceans of Yttre Bortom, leaving the planetsea caustic and the atmosphere choked with chlorine vapors.",,"Landing near the ruins of the main planetside terraforming hub, you’re immediately assaulted by the unpleasant burning sensation of breathing chlorine at a concentration just under hazardous. The buildings are pitted and scarred from corrosive rains, and the sea platforms seem to be crumbling underneath your feet. Every person you can see moving about is wearing hazmat scrubs. The lone saving grace is the pleasant temperature of the acidic seabreeze.",,
