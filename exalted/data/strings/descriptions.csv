anvil_delusion,SHIP,"The Delusion Drone wing is a simple, yet effective interceptor, capable of erasing most fighters in seconds thanks to its high firepower. The drawback of course, as with all Exalted designs, is that its fragile profile can easily and quickly be dealt with by point defense systems.",,,,,,,
anvil_wisp,SHIP,"An older heavy fighter from the days before their rise to glory, Wisps boast superior armor plating and conversely weak reactor power compared to other Exalted designs. Despite their age, Wisps see fairly regular use, and have been modernized with Fuego Blasters.",,,,,,,
anvil_fairy,SHIP,"Designed for supporting larger vessels which lacked the much needed kinetic weaponry for going against Tri-Tachyon armadas, the Fairy is a simple craft. It brings a small amount of Voodoo MRMs and a light shield generator to make sure it gets to its target safely, and is the Exalted's go-to bomber for any mission.",,,,,,,
anvil_plague,SHIP,"The Plague is an advanced craft, pushing the limits of what can be considered a fighter. It was envisioned as the perfect counter to the Tri-Tachyon fighter swarms and nimble frigate squadrons that often overwhelm Exalted Carriers.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_spirit,SHIP,"The Spirit was an attempt to make a proper combat ship as a gift for Exalted by following the idea of Mudskipper Mk.II. The Spirit has been in high demand since its first production run, due to its toughness and the heavy weapons it can mount. Often assigned as escort for larger ships as fire support, it's a common sight in Exalted fleets. The most common cause of losses are fighters, due to Spirit having a front shield emitter, which is why commanders are required to have at least some fighters of their own in the fleet to reduce overall crew losses.",,,,,,,
anvil_omen_ex,SHIP,"One of many blueprints stolen and altered by the Exalted during their exodus from Tri-Tachyon, Omen EX frigates are slower and have thinner armor than the base hull, but do have an upgraded and advanced flux core. EX Omens also have improved structural integrity compared to the base, increasing longevity.",,,,,,,
anvil_eerie,SHIP,"Focusing on defence, the Eerie is an unusual ship for Exalted doctrine, which has most frigates in an offensive role. It's a dependable craft built to hold the line alongside more durable ships and fill the holes in it if need arises. Its turret coverage makes it a perfect escort vessel and its system lets it distract enemy fire for way longer than most frigates. Despite these capabilities, there's evidence of Eeries being outfitted with close range weaponry and torpedoes. They are said to be used to charge at enemy lines and wreak havoc there, an effective tactic against some enemies of the Exalted.",,,,,,,
anvil_faint,SHIP,"The Faint is the fastest and most fragile craft in Exalted service and as such has earned it the blunt nickname ""rocket coffin"" due to its high mortality rate. despite the reputation this ship has earned it is a common sight in exalted fleet due to its cheap cost and ability to screen fighters for larger vessels",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_shrike_ex,SHIP,"One of many blueprints stolen and altered by the Exalted during their exodus from Tri-Tachyon, Shrike EX destroyerss are slower and have thinner armor than the base hull, but have an upgraded and advanced flux core. EX Shrikes also have improved structural integrity compared to the base, increasing longevity.",,,,,,,
anvil_apparition,SHIP,"A common sight in Exalted fleets, Apparitions are slow carriers made for those who see ""Point Defense"" as unnecessary addition. To that end, a shield generator providing full coverage, a heavy missile package, and remarkably inefficient engines that burn through fuel at an alarming rate make this ship an odd and fragile--but useful--addition to any fleet that can afford the luxury of fighter projection.",,,,,,,
anvil_phylactery,SHIP,"The Phylactery is a heavy refit of the common Buffalo freighter, with increased defenses and drive improvements to maximize speed. These ships are responsible for Exalted trade traffic and make sure the trade fleets run as quickly and smoothly as possible.",,,,,,,
anvil_vampire,SHIP,"The Vampire is a powerful mainline destroyer in the Exalted's roster. Large energy mount and a Temporal Shell system allow it to keep most threats at a distance while it goes after enemies weaker than itself. As strong as the Vampire is, it suffers from extremely quick loss of combat readiness due to its ship system. Hegemony fleet admirals are suggested to keep Vampires away with heavy firepower and to close in for the kill as they starts breaking down.",,,,,,,
anvil_cielo,SHIP,"The Cielo was built as a cheaper alternative to the Apogee Class but never found its footing until after the collapse where it had everything an upstart captain could need for a long trip into the unknown: a decent cargo bay, comfortable crew quarters, low fuel consumption, and advanced sensors to spot threats from light-years away.",,,,,,,
anvil_cielo_civ,SHIP,"The Cielo was built as a cheaper alternative to the Apogee Class but never found its footing until after the collapse where it had everything an upstart captain could need for a long trip into the unknown: a decent cargo bay, comfortable crew quarters, low fuel consumption, and advanced sensors to spot threats from light-years away.",,,,,,,
anvil_hoshiko,SHIP,"The Hoshiko is an odd vessel based on the hull of the Cielo Class to act as a modernized salvage vessel, While like the cielo it never found much use till after the collapse where this ship became a common sight in the fleets of Tri-Tach and wealthy independents.",,,,,,,
anvil_hoshiko_civ,SHIP,"The Hoshiko is an odd vessel based on the hull of the Cielo Class to act as a modernized salvage vessel, While like the cielo it never found much use till after the collapse where this ship became a common sight in the fleets of Tri-Tach and wealthy independents.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_lich,SHIP,"The Lich is a prototype defense cruiser built around the Halvete cannon, while not as effective as the wraith during most engagements the Exalted still kept this ship in service due to their limited resources and need for capable warships. Despite its flaws, it is still powerful force on the battlefield in its own right, and most captains are advised to avoid these ships at all costs.",,,,,,,
anvil_wraith,SHIP,"The Wraith is a nimble heavy-duty cruiser built to end the fight as quickly and efficiently as possible. The first ship to bring the Exalted's new Possession System to to the public eye (which has since been added to several other ships in their fleet), the Wraith's armor is outclassed by frigates, but its weapons package allow the craft to go head to head with capital ships. All in all, a powerful ship for any fleet able to afford it.",,,,,,,
anvil_fantasma,SHIP,"The Exalted's mainline carrier, The Fantasma is large, menacing, and fully capable of keeping up with the Hegemony's Moras in the frontlines thanks to its increased missile ordinance and wide weapons coverage. The original Fantasma was actually designed by Tri-Tachyon in an attempt to replace their Herons that ultimately failed, as it was too expensive to maintain for mass use. During their exodus, the Exalted stole the blueprint chip and any remaining prototype hulls that remained intact.",,,,,,,
anvil_urn,SHIP,"The bigger sister to the Phylactery-class, The Urn is a large, multi-role freighter built to hold its own against pirate raids and give light fighter support during large engagements. Where other civilian ships would be dead weight, the Urn is a capable escort frieghter with decent armor protection and defenses.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_priest,SHIP,"The Priest-class is the most powerful warship in the Exalted's arsenal, with a large array of weapons and fighters, advanced shielding, and impressive flux reactors, making this ship a dangerous enemy for any captain flying the hyperlanes. An Exalted rebuild of the Paragon, the Priest improves on the venerable Domain-era design with a notable shift on its original design philosophy and intended role. Few remain of this mighty vessel, and can only be found in the hands of the highest ranking Exalted officials.

The Priest was originally nothing more than a Tri-Tachyon engineer's daydream, to refit a Paragon into a dedicated carrier. However, given the presence of the Astral, their fellow employees originally laughed off the design team that originally proposed this comparatively costly refit. After their Exodus during the Second AI War, the Exalted were more open to unconventional new ideas without the corporate hierarchy vetoing the manufacturing process. Thus, the Revenant project was green-lit and several of their remaining Paragons have since been converted to these powerful, fully rebuilt and dedicated fleet carriers.",,,,,,,
anvil_odyssey_ex,SHIP,"The Odyssey EX was the Exalted's first custom capital, used as an exploration vessel to scout out a new home and find old tech to fuel the cause. Weakened armor, upgraded shields and a new heavy reactor make this ship a deadly foe in any fight.

What made this ship truly special was the addition of a prototype EMP system found early on during the Exalted's exodus. Unable to recreate the device, they decided to mount it on the Odyssey, hoping to give themselves an edge should they come under fire. It quickly became apparent that this device held incredible power, disabling an entire cruiser in the span of one activation. Any captain that finds themselves going against this legendary ship should keep their distance, lest they end up as another derelict drifting though space.
",,,,,,,
anvil_geist,SHIP,"The de-facto flagship of the Exalted, the Geist is a horror on the battlefield and feared by any captain who has the misfortune to encounter it. Capable of engaging multiple targets at once and, like most Exalted warships, it lacks any real armor, but makes up for it in its advanced reactor core and shield generator.",,,,,,,
anvil_nightmare,SHIP,"Originally rumored to be a large cargo ship due to the empty space seen in the hull while the first wave was being built in Tomb's orbit, what would become the Nightmare was thus largely ignored by the Exalted's enemies. Much to their horror, the first Nightmare-Class Heavy Carriers were unleashed and quickly showed that the Exalted mean business. Boasting an impressive comm system able to quickly relay information to and from its fighters, as well as bringing to bear a cruisers arsenal, the Nightmares, while not able stand up to Tri-Tachyon's Astrals, are worthy carriers not to be trifled with.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_gleam,WEAPON,"Originally designed for use on already disabled ships to shut down life-support systems and suffocate any remaining crew for easy boarding and recovery, the Gleam quickly came to be used in combat for its ability to nearly shut down an entire frigate in one shot, even while still fully powered. This comes, however, at the cost of high flux usage and slow fire rate.",,,,,,,
anvil_ecto,WEAPON,"The Ecto Beam is a modified Tactical Laser made to deal with vulnerable hulls and tough armor. With lower range, higher damage and flux requirements, this weapon is intended for use on the Exalted's high flux capacity ships.",,,,,,,
anvil_halvete,WEAPON,"The Halvete was designed to replace the Mordare Siege Cannon as the mainline weapon of choice for the Exalted's capital ships. While the project was a failure due to its heavy strain on regular Exalted ships, the Halvete nonetheless found its place on the unused Lich-Class Weapons Platform.",,,,,,,
anvil_varna,WEAPON,"The Varna PD Laser is an effective rapid-fire anti-missile laser built to replace the Burst PD Laser commonly seen around the sector. Like the Halvete, it failed in its task, but is still used as the Exalted's primary PD weapon.",,,,,,,
anvil_mordare,WEAPON,"The most powerful weapon in the Exalted's arsenal, the Mordare Siege Cannon was made for use on and against large battleships. Due to its large flux cost and sluggish turn speed, few cruisers can effectively mount this weapon.",,,,,,,
anvil_plasma,WEAPON,"Yet another prototype stolen from Tri-Tachyon, the Plasma Mortar fires high-yield plasma bolts that explode upon reaching its target, which are especially devastating for any fighter caught in its blast. Unsurprisingly, the Caster has a high flux cost and shouldn't be used en masse.",,,,,,,
anvil_voodoo_launcher,WEAPON,"Seeing a weakness in the Exalted's lack of ways to disable shields, Helig set out to design a specialized Harpoon for this exact need. While it is less effective at taking down shields then the Sabot it makes up for it in direct speed. So Helig was pleased with the result, leading to frequent use within the Exalted's fleets.",,,,,,,
anvil_voodoo,WEAPON,"Seeing a weakness in the Exalted's lack of ways to disable shields, Helig set out to design a specialized Harpoon for this exact need. While it is less effective at taking down shields then the Sabot it makes up for it in direct speed. So Helig was pleased with the result, leading to frequent use within the Exalted's fleets.",,,,,,,
anvil_voodoo_pod,WEAPON,"Seeing a weakness in the Exalted's lack of ways to disable shields, Helig set out to design a specialized Harpoon for this exact need. While it is less effective at taking down shields then the Sabot it makes up for it in direct speed. So Helig was pleased with the result, leading to frequent use within the Exalted's fleets.",,,,,,,
anvil_tierra,WEAPON,"The Mightiest of the Elemental line of weapons, the Tierra Burst Cannon is an alternative option to the Plasma and Mordare cannons by being cheaper to mount without sacrificing much firepower. A drawback to this is its inefficient flux usage that can take a toll on the mounted ship if used for long periods in battle without venting.",,,,,,,
anvil_aire,WEAPON,"The Aire Burst Laser came to be when the Exalted's focus on energy weapons proved it difficult to quickly deal with heavily shielded targets. Designed for use en-mass on smaller mounts, this fairly flux-efficient weapon fires a kinetically charged energy burst of lasers at high speeds with pin-point accuracy towards its target.

During the early phases of its life, the Aire blueprint and prototypes were nearly all destroyed after a failed test fire of the Fuego Blasters. Luckily, one of them survived for testing and further improvements, allowing the weapon to be a mainline weapon of choice on Exalted ships.",,,,,,,
anvil_fuego,WEAPON,"Developed as the sister to the Agua, the Fuego Blaster delivers heated energy bolts at high speeds from its chamber directly at its target with decent accuracy and manageable flux costs.



Along with its sibling weapons, the Tierra, Aire and Agua, the Fuego was part of the Elemental Weapons Program, an initiative to bring the Exalted's military and advanced scientific knowledge to the light of the sector. The program did not receive much support at first, barely getting enough funds to start work on one weapon, as Helig saw that they needed to direct resources to more reliable projects. That all changed when the Fuego Blaster attacked and quickly tore its target's armor to shreds, showing that the program has much promise and thus allowing continued development ",,,,,,,
anvil_agua,WEAPON,"A sister weapon to the Fuego developed during the Elemental  Weapons Program, the Agua is a Kinetically charged blaster based on the Pulse Laser commonly seen around the sector. Being one of few energy weapons able to reliably pressure shields makes the Agua a highly sought after-weapon, even by Tri-Tachyon captains.",,,,,,,
anvil_hielo,WEAPON,An inefficient but effective heavy rapid-fire kinetic weapon made to keep pressure enemy shields.,,,,,,,
anvil_trueno,WEAPON,"A heavy hitting high flux lightning rod which was initially developed as an end all anti-fighter weapon but quickly lost it's original goal as they continued to push the weapon to its limits, now unofficial dubbed an ""anti-frigate"" weapon the Trueno has become a threating weapon best avoided.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_possession,SHIP_SYSTEM,A strange energy surges through the ship to boost weapon damage by 20% and speed by 30.,,,,,,,
anvil_emp_ex,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates a Prototype EMP reactor. Nearby missiles and fighters, along with the weapon emplacements and engines of enemy ships, are all targeted and can be disabled in short order. Weapons are disabled while it is active.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
exalted,FACTION,"The Exalted are ex-Tri-Tachyon Corporation members who have grown to strongly dislike them over the years. Shortly after the Second AI War began, the forerunners of the Exalted took advantage of the chaos to flee the Core Worlds with a massive amount of ships, personnel and supplies. After the war ended, Tri-Tachyon was primarily occupied with rebuilding itself, and assumed the mass quantities of company property lost during their conflict with the Church and Hegemony was destroyed in the war. This ensured the Exalted's freedom and anonymity, allowing them to pursue their own goals.

The Exalted believe that advanced technology is the only hope to survive in the current political climate they find themselves in, and have come to the conclusion that Tri-Tachyon's abuse of technology, the Galactic Church's ignorance, and the Terran Hegemony's stubborn clingyness to a dead empire will be the end of humanity. Instead, these people choose to campaign against such beliefs. Within their short time in power, they have earned a reputation for being cruel and ruthless to any military officer unfortunate enough to be captured, but merciful to any innocents caught in between the crossfire of most battles.

It is a mystery as to how the Exalted were able to field such a powerful force so soon after their rise to power, but rumours in the Sector speculate of a high-ranking Independent leader being responsible. Some say Keruvim Shipyards secretly sent out massive supply fleets to unknown locations around the Sector, only to return with nothing but the clothing on their backs.

Whatever the case may be, the Exalted are a technocratic, independent power, and are largely a menace to the power-players of Sector affairs. They indeed are almost never alone in their goals or aims, as these same powers find themselves at odds with the Exalted, their allies and anyone else who stands in their way.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
anvil_tomb,CUSTOM,"Aptly named Tomb due to the millions of dead found in the vast ruins and the home of the Exalted. While Tomb isn't the richest in resources, it is a comfortable world where one does not need any sort of protection to live and breath, and that was enough for the Exalted to set up shop here.",,,,,,,
anvil_grave,CUSTOM,"An inhospitable and unforgiving world with little to give. With no other options in system, the Exalted have set up a mining base within an old volcano, which has stabilized over the years.",,,,,,,
anvil_crypt,CUSTOM,"A once abandoned mining station has been taken over by a large crime ring, looking for a safe place far from the Core to conduct their illegal operations. The ring has also restarted the mining rig as a cover for their activity, and gives the Exalted a good deal on metals, in return for the Exalted not blowing them up.",,,,,,,
anvil_kyrika,CUSTOM,"Kyrika is a surprisingly comfortable arid world with rich resources and breathable atmosphere. Due to this, Tri-Tachyon was quick to colonize the system to take advantage of it. While Tri-Tachyon's heavy presence has decreased the air quality quite a bit since their arrival, Kyrika is still a better place to live than much of the sector.",,,,,,,
anvil_catacomb,CUSTOM,"Catacomb is a large mining colony previously under Tri-Tachyon control that helped feed Kyrita raw resources for fleet construction. It recently came under Exalted command after a swift invasion fleet destroyed its meager defenses while another fleet distracted and disrupted Kyrita's defense force long enough to gain full control over Catacomb and tow an orbital station to the world, which held off any quick attempts at retaking it.",,,,,,,
