# NOTES
# Ship IDs entered here will be allowed by the Engineering hub (Reverse Engineering ship hulls)
# Ships that would break the game (Balance/Technical/Lore) if the player could produce them via blueprint should not be on this list.
"# Remember that we are all in this to have fun. Reverse Engineering is neither easy nor cheap, and forbidding too much takes away from player experience."
