periphery_star,CUSTOM,"A pulsar with the visible light of its beams encapsulated within an asteroid belt. A unique sight within the sector, it was Ludds illustration of this system that formed the basis of the Luddic crest. A holy flag conceived within the stars for all to bear witness.",,,,
periphery_planet,CUSTOM,"It was here, Ludd himself contemplated the fate of the sector before committing himself down the path that lead towards his final sacrifice. Considered a holy site within the sector, it is common for pilgrims and heretics alike to work the mines in penance for their sins. The site of the planetary shield, commonly referred to as Ludd's Ward, is forbidden territory.",,,,

Nergal_Lugalirra,CUSTOM,"The Sindrian Diktat's first foray outside Askonia, Lugalirra serves as a stopgap measure for increasing piracy against goods headed towards Sindria by enterprising pirates based in Umbra and elsewhere targeting the Askonia system. Though abundant in common ore, its volatiles are miniscule and transplutonic ore deposits ho-hum. When not shoring up deficits in Askonia, the mining bureau makes a moderate profit supplying the neighboring Mbaye's orbital works.",,,,
Nergal_Meslamtaea,CUSTOM,"A hub for Mbaye's questionable practice of speculative cryofreezing and commercial practices. Those looking to quickly turn their credits into more credits without the risks inherent in intersystem trading turn here. Of course, maintenance doesn't come by cheap and one bad investment may leave hopefuls thawed and penniless turning to the same piracy that dissuaded them from a trader's life.",,,,
Nergal_Observatory,CUSTOM,"Originally a research station, now, a military installation and ship manufactory, the Nergal observatory produces the civilian transports and starliners Mbaye are famed for. With the arrival of new neighbors, the orbital works begin to produce more warships as a check against any overly ambitious Diktat officers.",,,,

lido_planet,CUSTOM,"After reports of a virulent biohazard spreading across Cess, Tri-Tachyon quarantined the planet and poisoned the skies, killing the population. The objective was to prevent the spread of the biohazard throughout the system while preserving the infrastructure which held significant monetary value to the corporation. When the collapse came the Luddic Path saw an opportunity and recolonised the planet believing their faith would protect them.",,,,
ligan_planet,CUSTOM,"A colony of the slave variety. Originally a penal colony, when the inmates took over the guards were put to work. Any attempts to bring order to this place have been met with fierce discord and violence by the vying rabbles who have carved out their own special places in this hell.",,,,
station_flotsam,CUSTOM,Flotsam and Jetsam were constructed as part of a kite-racing track following Lagans rings. When the sponsors pulled out due to the inherent violence in the system an anarcho-syndicalist commune took over and decided the best way of settling draws was with a sword throwing contest. Needless to say the fans were mad and in a bloody take over turned to a life of crime to fuel their belt-racing obsession.,,,,

planet_scrumpy,CUSTOM,"Intend as an alternative site for the farm of the now famous Volturain Lobster breeding program, the higher acidity of the planets water made the seas unsuitable for purpose. With environmental impacts now defunct the planet was repurposed to fuel and ship production and the seas became a convenient dumping ground for by-products and waste",,,,
