I suppose I should probably start keeping track who've helped out in various ways:

Nex:
    - Nex Mining Weapons, ctuncks
    - Nex Profiles - Major thanks to vcuh666 and his assistant Nyctophonik who handled it brilliantly.
    - Nex Profile - Eridani - KMS, legend!

EVERYONE WHO GIVES FEEDBACK, especially the bastards on 4chan who aren't afraid to throw it in my face.

Snowball Enforcer:
Full credit to Limieczeczerz with Special Thanks to the Arthr for being dedicated to his craft and producing this magnificent little angel

Kristofferson:
For the Astral/Parralax - I CALLED DIBS!

Character Portraits:
All credit to pixel_rice_bowl and his AI that created them and will one day enslave us all.

Ludd, through him, all things are possible.
