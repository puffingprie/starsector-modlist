Location: Randis

As a newly-thawed you're probably wondering what's happened since you went under. Here's the short version; the investment portfolio you selected when you went into cryostorage went bust, all your assets have been liquidated and you owe us your cryorevival fees. As per the contract you signed we've assigned you a job in the refineries that you are required to work until our fees have been repaid, however, your profile indicates skills that would be better served elsewhere. We are in need of an independant commander, and that's where you come in.

There is a Ko Combine convoy leaving Arcadia with a fleet of drones, eliminate it. Your interception point is Randis. We have a phase fleet on standby so you can catch the convoy unaware and a detachement of our own drones will be in standby mode on the far side of Randis to help you deal with any unexpected re-enforcements.

Succesful elimination of the convoy will clear your debt and, as a bonus, we will grant you full salvage rights.

Welcome back commander.
