Revenge is justified.

Following the unwarranted destruction of a civilian convoy by a rogue Mbaye-Gogle detachment there was no need for words. An attack force has been mustered and sent to eliminate the threat. No politics, no bickering over hurt feelings. A simple message, donâ€™t mess with the KoC.

Those drones, they're weren't there before, but it makes no difference. Their ships will be ripped from the sky and those that survive will regret the living nightmare that has become their final days as they are hunted to extinction.
