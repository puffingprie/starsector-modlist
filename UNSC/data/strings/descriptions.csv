UNSC_Frigate_lightmac,WEAPON,"The Mark II MAC is the venerable workhorse of the UNSC fleet, serving on a multitude of UNSC ship classes over several decades. Although it has been outclassed by newer designs, it's ever-reliable punching power and range is still unmatched by most other weapon systems out there.

The magnetic-accelerator cannon, or MAC, is a type of coilgun widely used by the UNSC Navy that fires a ferric-tungsten shell at supersonic velocities. These powerful cannons are built along the length of most UNSC ships, and are capable of tearing apart enemy shields and hull alike at astounding range, at the cost of a low rate of fire and high flux usage.",,,
UNSC_Frigate_duallightmac,WEAPON,"This particular battery comes with two Mk. II MAC's built into it, allowing for two shots in rapid succession to overload an opponent's shields, or an increased maintained rate-of-fire to maintain pressure on the enemy.

unsc,FACTION,"The United Nations Space Command is the military, exploratory, and scientific agency of the United Earth Government (UEG).

After an exploration mission involving a Forerunner artifact went awry, a UNSC colonial fleet found themselves launched across time and space, ending up in the Persean Sector shortly after the collapse. Luckily, as a colonial fleet, they had sufficient resources to set up a temporary base of operations in the sector, and ended up taking over various planets through emergency UEG laws and provisions much like the Hegemony's XIV battlegroup found themselves doing some years prior. After a few diplomatic overtures however, the UNSC found themselves quickly at odds with the Hegemony and Luddic Church over their use of AI technology. 

Several years have passed since the UNSC's arrival in this sector, and the small UNSC force has steadily grew in power, filling gaps in its forces with whatever ships, technologies, and equipment they could find in this strange new world. Its scientists and AI's are working on researching their last hope of returning home - the mysterious ring-shaped gates that bore striking similarities to theconstructs built by the Forerunners that were responsible for sending them to the Persean sector in the first place.",,,
unscnewharvest,CUSTOM,"With the assistance of the escorting UNSC battlegroup, the UEG colonial group settled on the first habital planet they could find in the Persean sector. Although the frigid planet was just barely capable of growing crops and had adequate sources of organics to power the weather-control systems, it was disturbingly lacking in the metals and other materials needed to sustain a fleet. Because of this, UNSC authorities quickly elected to set up mining stations on the other planets in the system to make up for this shortfall.",,"As directed by traffic control, your shuttle pilot guides your craft from the frigid winds of the New Harvest surface to the climate-controlled sphere of New Harvest city. You take a moment to look out the window, admiring the sleek architecture and greenery of the port below.",
unscordelia,CUSTOM,"The barren planet of Ordelia was colonized in order to provide the vital metals and minerals needed for the construction of the UNSC's colonies and ships. It's cratered landscape is dotted with several mining facilities, where autonomous mining vehicles and workers operate around the clock to dig the rich, densely packed ores out of the deepest layers of the planet.",,"Your pilot guides your shuttle through the thin atmosphere of Ordelia with little fanfare, flying above arrays of Instacrete buildings and mining equipment. ",
unscostiastation,CUSTOM,"After researching the Forerunner orbital mining structures on the planet 'Threshold,' the UNSC were able to copy the design and use it for their own gas-giant mining operations. Ostia Station is an example of such a design, suspended in the atmosphere of the Ice Giant Ostia, where it gathers the crucial volatiles that fuel the UNSC's fleets.",,"Your shuttle pilot carefully flies through the thick gaseous atmosphere of Ostia, guided only by electronic nav-points towards the designated docking bay of Ostia Station.",
