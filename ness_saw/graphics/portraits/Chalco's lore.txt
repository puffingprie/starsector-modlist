Excerpt from the historian's notes:

"...A fascinating case indeed, while by no means unique in human history, its certainly first of its kind in the post collapse persean sector.

Member of "Ailuridae Mustela" a non-sapient species native to the Eventide,
Chalco, or Captain Chalco the VI to be precise, is a relatively small animal with striking red fur and curious eyes and more importantly, a favorite pet of High Hegemon Baikal Daud.

Promoted by His Highness to the rank of captain (in a burst of royal inspiration no doubt) and given a full fledged fleet detachment,
Chalco now spends his days leisurely napping in captain's seat, presumably overseeing his crew.

A somewhat peeved first mate(the former captain) performs all actual duties of command, while personally making sure Chalco receives all appropriate comforts.
Despite reduction in rank it is a promising appointment nonetheless, High Hegemon's goodwill is always in demand, especially for an officer in the Hegemony navy...

One item of a particular note is the captains suit.
An older suit model- bulky, robust and spacious was, along with several spares, modified to fit the creature.
Junior crewman is assigned to carry the suit and its inhabitant around, generally between the bridge and captains quarters..."
