Elyon's face disappears, replaced with a holographic recording of a pitched battle occuring outside of a very-much-intact space station of surprising size.

Soon, vac-suited marines are jumping offboard, quickly dispatching the hastily-assembled ""ground defenses"" that the Tri-Tach engineers and scientists are able to deploy. Lee himself enters the fray, trailing after his raiders.

Over the next hour, the pirate fleet outside of the station secures a narrow victory.

""The simultaneous stoppage of vital signs from the majority of Project Excelsior's executive personnel triggered a trap we had laid, deep within one of the Code-Omega contingency programs that no one aboard the station had the authority to review.

You stare for several moments, until you realize that the stars in the background are subtly bending inwards toward the station, as if the silent construct were somehow sucking in the light itself.
