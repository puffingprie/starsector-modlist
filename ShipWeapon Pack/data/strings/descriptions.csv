swp_dram_luddic_path,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary trimmings and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. A significant portion of the fuel capacity is removed in favor of a prominent central turret.

A light tanker with enough fuel capacity to more than double the effective range of a small task force or convoy.",,,,
swp_nebula_luddic_path,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary trimmings and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. A significant portion of the carrying capacity is removed in favor of a prominent central turret.

The voluminous but ungainly hull of the Huan-Gogel 430 ""Nebula"" does little to enhance the romance of interstellar travel but it does ensure a respectable passenger and cargo capacity for a ship of its class. Indeed, the Nebula has slowly come to dominate mid-tier passenger service since the muted reception of its first line of production.

The Nebula is equipped with a forward-facing shield to enhance the safety of passengers and extend the hull plating's maintenance schedule. And the Sector being what it is, several ballistic turrets and anti-missile all-band flare launchers have been mounted at fortuitous locations to assure paying passengers that their well-being is a top priority of the operator.",,,,
,,,,,,
swp_trebuchet,WEAPON,"A long-range guided missile with an unconventional gamma-pulse warhead. Designed to knock out the target's defenses, including any nearby escort craft. Only available on large mounts due to the Trebuchet's tremendous bulk.

With much of the missile's size taken up by its powerful thruster and deep fuel tank, the Trebuchet LRM is unsuitable for all but the largest housing slot. In many ways, it is an offshoot of the Ion Torpedo, affording similar (if not as dramatic) capability at a much longer range.",,,,
swp_hornet,WEAPON,"A rack of medium-yield evasive missiles. Adept at slipping past low-arc shields and precision point-defense systems.

Hornet MRMs employ a drunken flight path intended to confuse and disrupt point defense systems, making them more viable against ships that aren't overloaded - unlike most other types of guided missile. The Hornet is highly effective against smaller craft but can't easily crack the unsoftened armor of large warships.

In order to conserve fuel, Hornets will not exhibit swarming behavior until they are within the general proximity of the target.",,,,
swp_tornado,WEAPON,"A launching system that fires volleys of medium-yield evasive missiles. Adept at slipping past low-arc shields and precision point-defense systems.

swp_inferno,WEAPON,"Deploys a handful of swarming missiles at an extended range. Designed to overwhelm smaller targets, especially strike craft.

Despite being a somewhat clunky delivery system, the Inferno MIRV is brutally effective anti-small-craft weapon. Fighter jocks throughout the Persean Sector wince at the sight of even a friendly Inferno traveling downrange, knowing for certain that someone is about to die.",,,,
swp_lightninggun,WEAPON,"A long range tactical weapon with subpar damage but incredible accuracy. Particularly adept at disabling unshielded subsystems. Cannot be dodged.

The Electron Discharge Cannon, or the ""Lightning Gun"" as it is more widely known, operates through some now-forgotten abuses of quantum electrodynamics. At lightspeed, it transmits a large burst of electrical energy directly to the target. Behaves similarly to a beam weapon, except that the Lightning Gun generates hard flux upon impact with shields.",,,,
swp_redeemer,WEAPON,"An integrated launcher and assembler for a unique MIRV-style LRM. The main warhead deals torpedo-grade damage, but the chassis also houses a cluster of support missiles designed to soften the target just prior to impact.

An old LRM design, the Redeemer is far too bulky to be practical as a modularized blueprint. As a result, this weapon is presently found only on the Cathedral. According to legend, the Redeemer was responsible for defeating the aggressors of an Old Earth civil war, eons ago.",,,,
swp_reliant,WEAPON,"Fires a stream of high-velocity slugs. Cheap and accurate, but very weak.

The Reliant Heavy Machine Gun is adapted from surface-based repeating cannons. Its name belies its strength; the Reliant is one of the weakest weapons still used in space battles. Mostly used by civilian traders.",,,,
swp_contender,WEAPON,"A high-caliber anti-armor weapon. Sacrifices sustained firepower for excellent armor penetration.

The Contender Cannon is an oversized mortar that fires the largest shell that can be feasibly operated on a small weapon chassis. Its low rate of fire is a result of the slow manual reload process and the mandatory chamber cool-down period.",,,,
swp_flaregun,WEAPON,"Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. Any missile hitting a flare will be destroyed. Limited ammo, but very easy to mount.

The Flare Gun is a modular version of the flare launcher built into some hull blueprints.",,,,
swp_ionblaster,WEAPON,"A high-cooldown strike weapon with an immense EMP payload. Capable of disabling a large number of subsystems in a single shot.

The Heavy Ion Blaster fires a p-cohered cluster of exotic particles. Upon impact, it immediately undergoes nuclear transmutation, delivering an immense amount of ionizing radiation and electromagnetic energy into the target. After release, the blaster must vent its flux buildup to become safe to fire the next shot.",,,,
swp_iontorpedo,WEAPON,"A rack of advanced torpedoes with an energetic anti-subsystem area-burst payload. Secondary effects are deadly enough to wipe out nearby small craft.

This is a niche weapon with an esoteric p-packed ""clown car"" warhead that literally contains more payload than ought to physically fit. A cutting-edge weapon developed mere decades before the Collapse, the Ion Torpedo exploits common Domain flux conduit design, flooding the target with excess flux. The combined disruptive effects, although impressive, don't have the raw power of comparable anti-capital torpedoes; other weapons should be employed to finish off a disabled target.",,,,
swp_plasmaflame,WEAPON,"This weapon sprays plasma in a coherent stream, drawing from an internal fuel tank. Poor range, but very flux-efficient.

The Plasma Flamer is a glorified cutting torch, scaled up to warship-grade potency. While not effective against heavily-armored targets, this weapon does very well against shields and exposed hull, provided that the target is within its limited range.",,,,
swp_tripleflak,WEAPON,"A large, dedicated point-defense weapon. Capable of destroying swarms of missiles, knocking out torpedoes, and splashing groups of strike craft.

The Aegis Flak Cannon is the scaled-up big brother of the Flak Cannon and Dual Flak Cannon. Unlike the Devastator, this weapon is focused toward defense, lacking anti-warship utility but excelling at its role.",,,,
swp_lightphaselance,WEAPON,"A scaled-down Phase Lance, suitable for burning through armor and hull on a direct hit. Unsuitable for sustained pressure.

Despite its name, the Light Phase Lance isn't really ""light""; it's difficult to mount and boasts the same effective range as the full thing. This makes its tactical profile somewhat more limited than its otherwise excellent stats would suggest.",,,,
swp_microblaster,WEAPON,"A cheap PD-capable weapon. Extremely efficient, but low-performing.

The Mini-Blaster technically operates using the same technology that the Heavy Blaster does, just with cheap parts and severely downgraded power output. Intended for civilian use, this is the quintessential ""minimum viable"" PD weapon.",,,,
swp_microblaster_array,WEAPON,"A cheap PD-capable weapon. Extremely efficient, but low-performing. This continuous-fire variant can more reliably shoot down missiles than the base variant.

The Mini-Blaster technically operates using the same technology that the Heavy Blaster does, just with cheap parts and severely downgraded power output. Intended for civilian use, this is the quintessential ""minimum viable"" PD weapon.",,,,
swp_excelsiorcannon,WEAPON,"""The technology is almost inhuman. We don't have to imagine the Domain's mastery over reality; even our AI is struck silent in awe when we spin up that drive. Perhaps, somewhere in its machine heart, it feels the same fear that we do.""","- Anonymous technician's log entry, retrieved from the Excelsior's databanks",,,
swp_flareburst,WEAPON,"Releases missiles loaded with active flares that seek and destroy enemy missiles while scrambling their guidance systems. The launcher contains a mini-fac that produces additional ammunition on the fly, but the flares require a considerable amount of flux to activate prior to firing.

The Flare Burst MRM carries a large payload of active flares, each of which must first be charged at the moment of firing, due to their short activity half-lives. This weapon has a notably spectacular detonation, akin to the annual light shows on Eventide.",,,,
swp_gungnir,WEAPON,"Built into the Vindicator-class chassis, the Gungnir Cannon is a heavy artillery piece capable of shelling distant targets. Gungnir shells contain self-propelled scattershot, blanketing the target area with ordnance.

Gungnir shells are notably very large, eclipsing even the Hellbore in pure mass. A sophisticated shock absorption system transfers a significant portion of the backblast force into the barrel itself, which slides back along an inertial dampener track well into the ship's hull. As a result, the firing assembly and barrel are designed specifically to fit into the Vindicator's hull.",,,,
swp_gungnir_r,WEAPON,"Built into the Vindicator-class chassis, the Gungnir Cannon is a heavy artillery piece capable of shelling distant targets. Gungnir shells contain self-propelled scattershot, blanketing the target area with ordnance.

swp_klutotekhnes,WEAPON,"Large and powerful, this weapon can tear through the armor of even the largest vessels by raining upon them with a hail of high-explosive shells.

The Klutotekhnes Assault Gun predates the ubiquitous Hephaestus, the triple-barreled weapon displaying significantly greater firepower and ammunition capacity than its twin-barreled brother. Unfortunately, the Hephaestus variant became so much more popular - due to its much greater reliability and reduced complexity - that the Klutotekhnes survives today only as a permanent fixture of the Victory-class.",,,,
swp_droneflak,WEAPON,A defensive weapon system that fires shrapnel-filled shells equipped with a proximity fuse for maximum effect against small craft and missiles. Optimized for use on remote flak drones for the Albatross.,,,,
swp_microblaster_f,WEAPON,"A supercharged, continuous-fire variant of the Mini-Blaster. Can be overdriven even further to produce a withering hail of energy pellets.",,,,
swp_devastator_f,WEAPON,"This fighter-sized miniature Devastator is a a rapid-fire flak cannon, capable of tearing through missiles and other fighter craft at close range.",,,,
swp_mini_vulcan,WEAPON,A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. Even smaller than the typical Vulcan.,,,,
swp_swarmer_f,WEAPON,A short range guided missile launcher. The missiles are designed to intercept and destroy enemy fighters. Miniaturized for the Partisan.,,,,
swp_boss_camoturret,WEAPON,"This turret appears to be a slimmed-down, camoflaged version of the Mjolnir Cannon. The camoflage paint, unfortunately, does nothing useful in the vastness of space.",,,,
swp_boss_canistercannon,WEAPON,"An enormous cannon intended for launching spore canisters to planetary surfaces, this weapon is designed to be reconfigured for combat duties.",,,,
swp_boss_roycocannon,WEAPON,"""Would you like... a cup of soup?""",#NAME?,,,
swp_nightwalker,SHIP,"Built around a cutting-edge time alteration device and a single primary weapon slot, the Nightwalker phase destroyer is as potent and versatile as it is rare and expensive. Capable of making short time-hops through p-space.

The Nightwalker-class truly excels at lightning-fast hit-and-run sorties. The deadly combination of phasic time alteration and the Chrono Boost system allows for unprecedented combat maneuvers and devastating strike tactics, prompting inexperienced captains to over-commit and meet an early demise. Officer selection is particularly critical.",,,,
swp_cathedral,SHIP,"This eminent behemoth defies classification, more akin to a mobile station than a starship. The Cathedral is capable of overseeing operations for an entire battlegroup or singlehandedly undertaking deep-space colonization missions.

The Cathedral was originally known as the Explorer-class by the Domain Explorarium, a heavily-armed hubship designed to guarantee the success of new colonies. Soon after the Collapse, the remaining Explorers were quickly seized by militants on behalf of the early Church of Galactic Redemption. Each extant Cathedral is thought to be an original from this time period, kept in operation all this time as a sort of military guarantee; not only are they powerful combat flagships in their own right, each Cathedral is capable of launching an exodus into deep space, should the need arise.",,,,
swp_caliber,SHIP,"The Caliber-class destroyer offers a specialist role in combat, usually determined by the choice of weapon installed on its large spinal mount.
 Takes advantage of an integrated ammo-injection system to make the most of its primary armamen. Relies on a Damper Field for defense, conserving as much flux as possible for offense.

The Caliber is often contrasted with the Manticore; as the name implies, this ship is far more aggressive in nature, focusing entirely upon massive damage. While the Manticore is more effective against large ships, the Caliber is adept at trading armor for kills on other destroyers.",,,,
swp_archer,SHIP,"The Archer is an all-purpose missile destroyer, ideal for combat support roles due to its deep ordnance reserves and respectable direct-fire capabilities.

The Archer-class is designed to be used in conjunction with its contemporaries, such as the Hammerhead and the Eagle. While those common hulls are adept at putting on sustained pressure, the Archer makes for an excellent opportunistic strike vessel, a close support combatant, or a fire support platform.",,,,
swp_zenith,SHIP,"Rarely seen, the Zenith represents the pinnacle of Domain ""high tech"" design - a veritable powerhouse capable of outlasting and overpowering just about anything in front of it. Vulnerable to flanking.

Beware the Zenith's inability to disengage. Novice Zenith captains often overcommit and become surrounded, which can spell doom even for this hardy heavy cruiser.",,,,
swp_vulture,SHIP,"A fast cruiser with a balanced layout consisting of each type of weapon slot. With wide firing arcs and good missile coverage, the Vulture does well in support roles and is notably difficult to pin down. Comes with a non-replenishing complement of small PD drones.

The Vulture-class is a distant offshoot of the Heron design, as evidenced by the vestigial drone bay - once the spacious flight decks of its carrier cousin. Common tactics involve circling at stand-off distances, unloading missiles and long-range batteries while heavier ships engage directly. The Vulture is usually at a distinct disadvantage at close range once its PD drones are depleted.",,,,
swp_archon,SHIP,"This heavy destroyer has exceptional combat presence for its size, owing to a ""fortress"" shield generator and an aggressive array of fixed-forward firepower. Features a ""flux shunt"" system that allows the ship to withstand sustained cruiser-grade firepower, but so much internal space is sacrificed that it almost entirely lacks rear defenses.

The Archon is, in many ways, the younger cousin of the Paragon, utilizing a blend of firepower and indomitability rarely seen in so-called ""high tech"" ship design. It is thought that the two ships were once competing designs, but today the original manufacturer's name has been forgotten.",,,,
swp_arachne,SHIP,"An atypical hull with state-of-the-art combat sensors and targeting systems, the Arachne combines frigate-grade weapons with capital-grade range. Heavily shielded and impossible to flank, the Arachne lives and dies by its range advantage; in a close-quarters battle, it has few options.",,,,
swp_excelsior,SHIP,"This half-finished ship is barely space-worthy, requiring a variety of exotic replacement components to remain in continuous operation. A testbed for poorly-understood technologies developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Excelsior embodies the hubris of mankind by delving layers of reality that should have remained unsounded.

This one-of-a-kind frigate flips every convention of space warfare on its head, granting incredible advantages in combat, but rendering the accursed vessel nigh-unusable by any but the most skilled - and recklessly insane - captain. If the Excelsior can be fully mastered, however, its capabilities are truly limitless.",,,,
swp_alastor,SHIP,"Sometimes called the ""Baby Eagle"", the Alastor is an all-rounder frigate capable of handling itself in almost any situation. Falls short of more specialized frigates in their respective fortes.

The Alastor-class frigate was probably designed to fill out small patrols in much the same way that Eagles fill out heavy patrols. This tough-but-maneuverable hull lacks in overall offensive capability, but does well in groups, making it ideal for when a straightforward, reliable frigate is required for general duties.

Some captains swear by the Alastor, claiming marvelous feats of bravado enabled by the small frigate, but such descriptions are surely idealistic and not representative of real-world performance characteristics.",,,,
swp_circe,SHIP,"A high-end armed freighter. The Circe is widely considered the premier combat freighter of the Persean Sector, reserved for only the wealthiest of merchants dealing in the most valuable of goods.

The Circe is thought to have been designed as an armed personnel vessel, as evidenced by its spacious cabins and luxorious crew suites. After production, most of these berthings are stripped out in favor of additional cargo capacity.",,,,
swp_sunder_u,SHIP,"This rare variant of the Sunder belongs to the ""high tech"" design philosophy. Generally considered to be the superior - and more recent - iteration, it is identified with a ""U"" tag, meaning ""upgraded"" or ""ultra"".

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft.","This rare variant of the Sunder belongs to the ""high tech"" design philosophy.

swp_albatross,SHIP,"Purpose-built for fleet escort duties, the Albatross is a hardy-but-flexible destroyer that services flak drones to defend against missiles and small craft.

Records indicate that the Albatross-class was not a popular chassis. This late-blooming design only recently found its place in the Persean Sector due to the overwhelming prevalence of conflict in these trying times.",,,,
swp_vindicator,SHIP,"The Vindicator is a heavy support cruiser, owing to its built-in targeting systems, purpose-designed long range cannon, and heavy missile capabilities.

Oddly, the Vindicator blueprint commonly available today is actually a modification of the original design, probably made late in the Domain's history. Upon cursory inspection, it is clear that the original designers intended for the ship to wield two Gungnir Cannons. However, one of them has since been removed from the blueprint, in favor of mounting a modern large missile module and rapid loading system.",,,,
swp_vindicator_o,SHIP,"The original Vindicator, designated with the tag ""S"" or ""stock"", lacks the missile capabilities of the more common variant. In return, it sports unmatched long range firepower, thanks to a pair of Gungnir Cannons and an accelerated ammo feeder system.

swp_punisher,SHIP,"The Punisher mixes massive, interlocking armor belts with an enormous network of thrusters, granting both mobility and durability to this unorthodox - but formidable - light cruiser.",,,,
swp_victory,SHIP,"The Victory-class battleship was designed as a direct competitor for the Onslaught. Though it never obtained great fame, the Victory is still valued for its unmatched raw firepower. A terrifying menace when deployed correctly.

Though the Victory has firepower exceeding even a Paragon or Onslaught, it lacks the Onslaught's immense armor layering and the Paragon's fortress shield. This has given the Victory a well-deserved reputation as the sector's most fragile battleship.",,,,
swp_beholder,SHIP,"Eschewing mobility in favor of heavy armor and a specialized drone-servicing bay, the Beholder augments its firepower with a quadruplet of all-purpose laser drones. Extremely effective at eliminating missiles and small craft in a wide zone, but also useful in traditional close support roles.

Few know exactly how the Ray drones were developed, but they are a definitely a derivative variant of Terminator drones. Rather than being free-roaming hunter-killer units, Ray drones are more like floating turrets, effective against larger ships in addition to small craft. The price, unfortunately, is that the AI capabilities are dramatically reduced; Ray drones are fixed in formation with the mothership.",,,,
swp_chronos,SHIP,"The Chronos is an unconventional battlecruiser, relying more on finesse than brute force. Excellent mobility (for its size) and a time acceleration system allows this ship to perform maneuvers and concentrate firepower like no other... but only in quick bursts. The rest of the time, far-field electronics jamming equipment and advanced quant-op units augment the Chronos' fleet support capabilities.

The Chronos has a bizarre hull layout  - likely a compromise to permit the capital-grade Temporal Shell to be installed - which offers certain distinct advantages and disadvantages; weapon outfitting is quite limited for this battlecruiser, but thrust vectoring is maximized to permit tight turns.",,,,
swp_hecate,SHIP,"The nimble Hecate corvette is not quite small enough to be produced directly by fighter manufactories, but it is regardless one of the fastest and most compact frigate hulls available today. Hecate tactics rely on making the best possible use of its limited weapons capabilities - it is normally incapable of outgunning any other warship.",,,,
swp_nautilus,SHIP,"A common hullframe, the Nautilus is best described as a more expensive Hound. Widely available, reasonably combat-capable, and surprisingly comfortable to sleep in.",,,,
swp_vortex,SHIP,"The Vortex is a rare light carrier with battlecarrier capabilities. Adept at deploying swift, brutal strikes, thanks to the ability to wrap itself and its accompanying fighter craft in a temporal field. Loses much of its bite when its system is recharging.",,,,
swp_striker,SHIP,"Favored by the bold, the Striker is a cheap light destroyer with a basic array of forward-facing weapons. Typically seen as a more accessible alternative to the Shrike, making it popular with the Luddic Church. Notable for coming standard with a large internal magazine for additional missile ammunition.

The Striker actually began its life as an unarmed exploration hull, filled to the brim with sensors, spacious cargo holds and advanced propulsion systems. Over many cycles, its original manufacturer gradually militarized the design into the armed and armored rocket we see today - a good fit for the Persean Sector.",,,,
swp_eos,SHIP,"Thought to be a downsized Astral variant, the Eos-class is a true behemoth of a carrier. Fitting as much deck space as a Legion despite its cruiser size classification, the Eos grants capital-class fighter projection to fleets that can't field larger vessels. Efficient, considering its strike potential and advanced systems, but lacks much auxiliary firepower beyond its flight decks.

The Eos-class carrier makes a number of sacrifices to fit so many flight decks on a small, efficient frame. Chief among these is the lack of thrusting power, awarding the ship its well-earned reputation for sluggishness. Apparently, the designers focused all efforts on tuning travel drive performance, leaving in-combat engine capabilities by the wayside.

Another major problem is the miniaturized reactor, which - while fairly reliable and easy-to-replace - lacks adequate flux vent space. Aftermarket modifications can more than double the Eos' reactor performance, albeit at a cost.

Finally, the Eos-class comes standard with what can be described as ""modest"" capacitor banks. Late-epoch ultra-efficient shield tech keeps this from being a fatal flaw, but heavy weapons can quickly run the Eos dry.",,,,
swp_liberator,SHIP,"The Liberator-class defies classification, being somewhere between a battleship and a battlecruiser in speed and defenses. While its weapon systems are nonetheless quite formidable, the mobility offered by the Liberator's burst jets and the versatility of its flight deck grant this light battleship strong all-around capability, capable of taking on any size of ship (with the right loadout).

Information about the Liberator's origin have mostly been lost to time, but design-wise it seems to be some kind of middle-ground between the Odyssey, the Conquest, and the Onslaught. Uncharacteristically for ""low tech"" ships, this one is quite maneuverable and even sports a rather substantial omni shield. Combining this with extremely heavy armor, the Liberator comes across as a very ""forgiving"" ship for its size class, suitable for well-connected but inexperienced brass to take command; however, its true power is only evident in the hands of a truly skilled commander.",,,,
swp_liberator_luddic_church,SHIP,"This modification of the Liberator-class light battleship trades the flight deck for a missile system hard-coded to launch a barrage of Hammer torpedoes.

swp_shimmer,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the TriTachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The feared Shimmer carrier is able to deploy four wings of drone fighters in combat. The Shimmer's weapon loadout is light but flexible, able to be configured for added point-defense protection or for punishing missile volleys.",,,,
swp_wall,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Rarely seen, the Wall is an amalgamation of lesser automated hulls - typically Rampart modules - that serves to form an indomiatable bulwark against the Domain's foes. The Wall is more a deterrent than a ship-of-the-line, adept at crushing everything directly in front of it. Due to its haphazard construction, the Wall can be broken into pieces and remain operational; up to three distinct AI cores can be found on a single Wall. No manufactory was ever configured to produce this Frankenstein's monster; how it came into being is a complete mystery.",,,,
swp_solar,SHIP,"The TriTachyon Corporation officially denies the existence of the Solar battlecarrier, a somewhat paradoxical claim given the fact that ""Solar"" is a TriTachyon registered trademark. Thought to be a battlestation design that was scrapped after the start of the First AI War, deep-space explorers more recently reported sightings of enormous automated combat vessels, each boasting several flight decks and an unmatched arsenal of weapon systems arrayed across a wide hull.",,,,
