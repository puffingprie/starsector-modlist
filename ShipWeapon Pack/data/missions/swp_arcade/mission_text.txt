Kick ass and take names! Fight through a horde of random ships, elite mooks, and seven boss fights.

You earn points by destroying ships and bosses. Chain kills together to gain a combo multiplier for a massive score! The point multiplier increases with each difficulty level. If you beat the final boss, any unused powerups are worth 5000 points each.

Yellow: Armored. 2x Points.
Green: Shielded. 2x Points.
Red: Powered. 2x Points.
Blue: Elite. 4x Points.

Hidden ends await you if you eschew the use of one or both types of powerups until the final boss...

Make sure floating messages are enabled.
