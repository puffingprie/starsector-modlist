Location: In orbit around Gilead
Date: 107.2.15

In the final months of the First AI War, a surprise attack by an autonomous AI battlefleet decimated the local patrols in Canaan, posing an existential threat to the millions of people living on the garden planet Gilead. Distress calls to nearby Hegemony forces largely went unanswered, only a token force arriving in-system to "monitor the situation".

Whether by divine inspiration or unsafe quantities of stims, the Knights of Ludd somehow managed to recommission one of the Luddic Church's old Explorer-class hubships - ahead of the AI incursion.

The aftermath of this battle - and the Hegemony's reluctance to commit assets in defense of their neighbors - ultimately led to the Church of Galactic Redemption declaring the end of their partnership and to the Hegemony's subsequent declaration of the end of the war.
