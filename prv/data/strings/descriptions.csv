#############################,,,,,,
prv_gnista,SHIP,"Built to support larger ships, the Gnista ensures missile superiority through a combination of once-cutting-edge active flares, light point defense, and its own missile armaments. The ship is unlikely to end many fights on its own, however.

An older prv model, the Gnista was built as a competing offering to the Vigilance frigate. Though it was rejected by the Domain navy, the prv still managed to salvage the program by competing on price, successfully selling the ships to a number of smaller polities in need of cheap patrol craft.

Though not the most common ship in the sector, after hundreds of cycles travelling the starlanes on all sides of the law the Gnista is a tried and true ship with its flaws and virtues known to most spacers.",,,,
prv_ljus,SHIP,"A sensor frigate built for long patrols in the far reaches of space. In addition to a state-of-the-art detection suite the Ljus also carries a modest armament.

After numerous convoy losses to unknown parties prv Starworks started development of a picket ship capable of providing early detection and warning against incoming raids. Priorities were excellent sensor strength, high endurance for extended patrols in both regular and hyperspace, and combat damage avoidance in convoy defense. Breadth of armament, tactical speed, and core structural integrity were considered secondary goals at best.

Combat survivability was achieved in two ways, one very simple and one very complicated. First, additional armor plating was applied to the hull (but not, some will note, the sensor arrays). For its thin frame and small size the Ljus is surprisingly well armored. Second, a deal was struck with the Tri-Tachyon Corporation for them to develop a delta-tier AI system that allows the Ljus to reconfigure its deep space sensor array to instead increase combat targeting range. This ”Lykta” system allows the Ljus to support fellow ships from outside the range of most threatening strike weapons found in the sector.

The advanced sensor array has proven to be very susceptible to battle damage, leading to a generous amount of (D)-grade hulls being available for purchase across the sector.",,,,
prv_flamma,SHIP,"A patrol frigate that revels in being the biggest ship in the smallest engagements, the Flamma is a natural companion to the Ljus frigate on local patrols. Offering energy or missile firepower and a potent gravitic shield the Flamma outmuscles the typical frigate while still being fast enough to outpace destroyers and larger ships. That's the ideal, anyway. Proponents call it a pocket destroyer, while detractors dismiss it as a ”fat, lazy cow”. 

While generally unassuming, the Flamma is quietly regarded as the second pillar of the prv, being the first mass-line ship with a graviton-manipulation system. As a technological and doctrinal springboard it has led to a silent revolution in the corporation’s direction.

Readily available and generally competent, the Flamma’s quiet work supporting the rest of the fleet often comes out to be the glue that keeps the prv house of cards together.",,,,
prv_gryning,SHIP,"A light and agile frigate equipped with light armaments and a time-warping device that lets it - in effect - speed up the local flow of time by a noticeable percentage and maintain this level for significant periods of time.

Public records about the history of this ship are exceedingly scarce. What little there is suggests that the Temporal Core is reverse-engineered from a Tri-Tachyon ship, and that the prv failed to maintain the same tach-field precision levels as the Scarab, having to settle for a low-potency but longer-lasting generator.

In the prv the Tachyon Workers' Union (motto: ""Live fast, die old"") recently lost a case concerning whether work hours should be counted based on subjective time or standard time - the ""Time and a half"" case, as the public would call it. The final statement of the court concluded that ""[...] even though work can feel like it drags on forever, this does not change the fact that we have materially objective and reliable timekeeping devices which are more than sufficient at giving us a common frame of reference for the passage of time. Furthermore, this court obeys the laws of causality in accordance with Domain statutes.""

Many temporal academics have objected to the ruling, but arguments about why it would be mistaken tend to get bogged down in solipsism or outright rejection of the possibility of shared frames of reference.",,,,
prv_sinne,SHIP,"A fast attack frigate equipped with advanced Domain-era technologies, the Sinne’s powerful flux lines enable it to stand up to even light cruisers in direct combat. A deadly ship by any measure.

The Sinne was undergoing final trials at the time of the gate system collapse, representing some of the finest work the prv had ever done. This rude interruption of all known society caused some delays in the development of the ship. Now rescued from the deep archives of Kratul Heavy Industries by a dedicated development team, the Sinne is finally ready to make its mark on the sector; an impertinent youth from a lost era.

prv leadership were somewhat concerned when they found out that their TriPads had contained a largely accurate technical readout since long before they were even aware that the project’s data archives had survived into the post-collapse.",,,,
prv_fasnod,SHIP,"Disruptive to the extreme, the Fasnod's reason for existence is to wreak havoc on enemy battle cohesion. A quick flanker in itself, the Fasnod also carries a light phase teleporter used to deploy gravity mines. Only the most solid fleets can maintain their formation against a determined gravity mine attack.

Fasnod ship insignias often include cats, for their fondness of toying with their prey. Experienced crews have been known to hit vulnerable ships many times in a row with well-planned mine strikes, rebounding the target from one mine to another. Others have directed light ships into their heavier comrades, with devastating results.",,,,
prv_ande,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Ande is an integrated system that allows a group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites.

The swarm intelligence of an Ande is very poor, and rarely reaches even low delta levels. As an ”instinctual” system it does however function quite well while operating within its pre-set design scenarios. Most notably, the system allows the fighter swarm to coordinate their engine emitters and jump into hyperspace, something that generally requires at least a corvette-sized craft.

The logistical abilities of an Ande could be generously described as ”limited”, and largely consists of a few specialized containers carried by the fighters. The towed crew cabins are known for being very cramped, but surprisingly comfortable.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,,

### Ships,,,,,,
### prv Destroyers,,,,,,
#############################,,,,,,
prv_tystnad,SHIP,"The final product of an experimental miniaturized combat carrier program by Kratul Spacewharfs. The Tystnad is a support ship through-and-through with only moderate direct firepower but the versatility to carry a wide array of support fighters and drones. 

The primary armament of the Tystnad is a ballistic battery located in the aft of the ship. This is complemented with a wing of support fighters, generally Oväsen models, and a group of slaved missile drones. Protection comes in the form of a narrow but efficient omni-shield and a barebones layer of hallbar armor honeycomb.

One of the many compromises involved in fitting a flight deck onto such a small ship is that the hangar carries only the bare necessities to operate its integrated wing of fighters and can only replace a few combat losses before exhausting itself. Additionally it can only be adjusted to fly more offensive fighter craft with difficulty, as the default configuration is focused on close ship/fighter integration over more independent operations.

The ship is infamous among Persean crews for having a tendency of breaking in half when struck laterally. There is a persistent rumor of an unnamed captain who replaced the rear PD mounts with Antimatter Blasters and caused a mutiny through his habit doing close-range assaults in order to bring them to bear. 

The prv consider the same configuration to be standard issue.",,,,
prv_eld,SHIP,"An agile and flexible destroyer that can be outfitted for most mission profiles. Its advanced tensor drive gives it a somewhat ”bursty” movement pattern. In the prv officers are often given command of an Eld very early in their careers, as a trial by fire and as an excellent way for a young talent to prove themselves. Attrition rates tend to be high, but the officers that complete their assignments often do go on to become the naval elite.

There are many differing opinions on how the Eld is best utilized, from the conservative Elite school who believe that range and kinetics are the key to dictating a battle, to the reckless captains who prefer to redline all their equipment, firm in their belief that there’s no such thing as a best defense against a well-tuned plasma drive. The opinions of the Missile Corps are obvious, debates on torpedoes versus guided missiles aside. There are also the Hunter cadres, a little-spoken-of group who utilize gravitonic equipment to isolate enemy support ships and defeat them in detail.",,,,
prv_ballebo,SHIP,"A mostly forgotten ship, the Ballebo was once the prv’s flagship model destroyer. It never achieved any particularly impressive production numbers however, and by now the ship is largely a footnote in the company histories.

Normally a fairly slow ship, the Ballebo's engine core is configured to generate and store excess plasma, which can then be expelled through a set of maneuvering jets located on the sides of the ship, greatly increasing speed and agility for a limited time. ",,,,
prv_fasklot,SHIP,"The Fasklot is a speedy ship ideal for punishing distracted opponents. A light phase teleporter allows it to deploy groups of EMP mines to cripple its targets.

Generally thought of as dishonorable to the extreme - as if there’s such a thing as honor when men try to destroy each other. Fasklot crews are well aware of their reputation, and will ask no quarter. Certainly none would be given to a craft specialized in killing the disarmed.",,,,
prv_brand,SHIP,"One of the rare examples of technological advancement in the sector, this ship combines high-quality components from the height of the Domain-era with more recent advancements in gravitonics and drive technology in order to offer a deadly hunter-killer craft.

The Brand utilizes a late Domain-era shield emitter and power generator in combination with a potent gravitic field emitter and a few well-applied techniques from the prv’s tensor drives. Combined with a heavy energy weapon, the Brand offers a level of performance that could have seen it operating in the core worlds of the Domain. Or at least, it might have by standards 200 cycles past.

Production of new Brands is difficult and generally stalls when it’s time to install the reactor. Finding usable Antima-Re/87s has proven to be challenging to say the least, and to the best of anyone’s knowledge there exists no still-functioning production chips for it, or any compatible model, in the sector. Indeed as the few Brand captains are well aware, even simple wear-and-tear parts for it such as 304kWb flux catalysers are becoming increasingly elusive.",,,,
prv_sorl,SHIP,"A relatively well-armed combat carrier that reliably outperforms the ”flying landing strip” models so common in the sector, but is in turn significantly more expensive to maintain and field.

Dissenting voices in the prv often question the wisdom in operating the Sorl. The question asked is if it would not be better to field three Condor auxiliaries instead of two Sorl. Satisfying answers are few, and between political inertia and the potential cost of retooling the manufactory the Sorl production line keeps chugging along.",,,,
prv_gast,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Gast is a vast integrated system that allows a large group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites. The bot swarm also includes weapon elements, enabling it to take minor offensive action.

The swarm intelligence of a Gast is poor, and rarely reaches even middling delta levels. It has however shown a curious tendency to bond to its pilots. In a few cases, after sustaining heavy fighter losses Gasts have been known to refuse further combat orders entirely. For the swarm to regain combat effectiveness prv service technicians had to replace the fighter-side neural coordinators and retrain the system from scratch.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,,

#############################,,,,,,
prv_is,SHIP,"Designed to hunt and disable high-value targets, the Is is equipped with a fearsome tachyon system and a potent strike weapon of choice. These days it is usually regarded as a ”high-value target” in itself.",,,,
prv_flock,SHIP,"A somewhat fragile light cruiser with an integrated high-end missile launch system capable of launching sustained salvoes of Kråka MRM missiles. A limited number of hardpoints allow the ship to pair this with either a wide selection of missiles, or a more reliable suite of energy cannons.

One of the more popular fire support platforms of the prv, the Flock’s flexible automatic launcher allows for smooth transitions between harassing fire, heavy strikes, and saturation bombardment.",,,,
prv_kakafoni,SHIP,"Multirole cruiser that carries a wide gun or missile array and a moderate fighter complement. These ships effortlessly fit into just about any fleet, offering a somewhat defensive blend of firepower and durability.

Kakafoni cruiser-carriers carry two wings of fighters, a diverse armament and reasonable point defense. They are protected by a prv-characteristic narrow band omni-shield generator and a respectable armor belt. Maintenance costs are somewhat high due to the numerous different capabilities covered by the ship.

The ever-reliable rock in the storm, the anchor, the beating heart of prv battlefleets.",,,,
prv_aska,SHIP,"Imposing and terrifying, the Aska utilizes an enormous phase teleporter to move around the battlefield and hunt down opposing ships. Armed with an assortment of ballistic, energy and missile weapons this powerful cruiser is more than capable of taking down its prey.

The lumbering and bulky form of the ship belies the true speed it can move at. By stutterjumping up to eight times a minute the Aska can outpace most ships in the sector. Though, it must be admitted that the ship is not the most agile thing around - standard engine performance has taken second seat to the ability of teleportation, no doubt.

Built to do everything the Kakafoni does not, the Aska brings a punishing weapons array, capable of mounting the very largest missile and energy systems that can be found in the sector. Powerful, aggressive and destructive. One of the finest products of the spacewharfs at Kratul.",,,,
prv_fasvinge,SHIP,"A high-tech strike cruiser equipped with a rapid phase shift system operated by a dubiously legal AI. Seeing a Fasvinge in spite of its stealth fields is considered a bad omen by superstitious spacers; misfortune will follow.

Exhibiting the typical AI aversion to phase space, the flicker system’s AI core tends to be - in the words of one Tidsbörsen ATH psychotechnical assessment - ”very unhappy” about its situation. Although AI cores of this relatively low level of sophistication generally do not exhibit personality traits, the flicker cores have still managed to gain a reputation for being remarkably unhelpful. Diagnostic data generally comes out garbled, or in a few instances, explicitly insulting.",,,,
prv_valnad,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Vålnad is a vast integrated system that allows a large group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites. Much larger than other integrated swarm systems, the Vålnad can overwhelm most ships with its prodigious fighter squadrons.

The decision to base the neural net of the Vålnad on a Labrador Retriever has resulted in the system being easily trained, eager, and moderately obedient. Its tendency to get overenthusiastic and overtaxing its flux systems has however led to the loss of several of the prototype systems. Alternative neural patterns are being investigated, such as the old earth octopus or the Kratul I rovälg.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,,

#############################,,,,,,
prv_valljud,SHIP,"A lively combat carrier equipped with an underhanded disruption system, the Välljud is adept at delivering effective strikes against even the toughest targets. However, this offensive focus comes at the cost of durability and the ship will quickly fall to a determined assault.

The primary capital-class ship manufactured at the Works over Utbo. The prv top rungs used to regard the Välljud as somewhat of a failure - until an upgrade program equipped the class with the now infamous disruption zone generator, turning it into a disturbingly effective strike platform.",,,,
prv_rok,SHIP,"As a matter of faith as much as doctrine, the prv believe that defenses are used to enable offensive action, a principle exemplified in the Rök, which carries heavy armaments and for a battlecruiser uncharacteristically strong defenses. The class is however also known for having a tendency to use up its entire flux capacity in a matter of seconds.

The class is considered a strategic-level threat by the Hegemony due to its powerful anti-ballistic gravity shield, and incidents of sabotage of the remaining Rök ships have become so common that the prv press no longer reports on it not for reasons of secrecy, but simply because ”dog bites man” is not news. At any given time several Rök are likely to be laid up for critical repair work - often waiting for parts that are increasingly impossible to get a hold of. The entire affair has led Pariabyrån - prv covert intelligence - to be considered entirely unreliable when it comes matters of counter-intelligence.",,,,
prv_skymning,SHIP,"The largest ship operated by the prv, these behemoths carry a wide array of sophisticated weapons and fighters. The Skymning is built for head-on engagements and breaking up packs of smaller ships, and is fit with an integral tensor drive which gives the ship a highly dynamic engagement profile.

Unlike most prv ships the actual design of the Skymning significantly predates the collapse - and the enormity of the undertaking had the entire corporation struggling to stay solvent. When the time came to move from low-volume initial production to mass manufacturing, Domain politics turned against the project, which was characterized as wasteful and redundant. Funding was pulled. Most hulls that had been laid down had to be put in indefinite storage while the prv administration scrambled for funds to restart the production lines. The corporation was overleveraged, all contingencies had been used up, and the entire shipbuilding division was looking at dissolution. 

And then, the collapse happened. 

One of three Skymning production facilities was located in the now-isolated sector; the wharves orbiting Kratul. In spite of the logistical challenges brought on by the turmoil of the post-collapse, a number of Skymning battleships have been finished from previously laid-down hulls - a major factor behind the prv's waxing influence in the region.

The question of the corporation's outstanding debts remains unresolved. It is suspected that creditors will have to enforce any claims by force of arms.",,,,
prv_morker,SHIP,"Constructed around the last three graviton cores to pass through the gates before the collapse, this Mörker is an irreplacable relic of a bygone era.

While graviton cores are still being manufactured in the sector, production is intermittent and the capabilities of the finished cores are dubious at best. prv Sista Dagen, the only Mörker-class that will ever be constructed, carries a full set of entirely pristine cores, with unmatched performance.

Perseiska Kompaniet, the prv house operating the battleship, use the ship as the core of a mobile reserve battlegroup - kept well away from Hegemony naval intelligence, Pather fanatics or Tri-Tachyon saboteurs. The secrecy involved has led to the fleet acquiring a somewhat mythical status, not to mention a significant amount of prestige. It is rarely deployed for combat, but has been victorious in every battle it has seen - so far.",,,,

#############################,,,,,,
prv_tiger,SHIP,"Combat tanker with a solid flux system and real bite in its armaments.

Most fleet commanders in the sector scoff at the idea of sticking guns on a tanker. The prv disagree, and build the Tiger. Offering a capable combat platform with a sizable amount of well-protected fuel storage, the Tiger makes sure that the fleet comes home again. Built in the same facilities as the Flamma frigate, the Tiger shares many structural parts with its smaller sibling and is designed entirely to military specifications.

The sector at large continues scoffing. The Tiger still finds a customer base however, as there are more than a few skippers who feel that a half-dozen machine guns just aren't enough to keep his fellow man honest in the depths of space.",,,,
prv_ilbud,SHIP,"Phase courier ship with a healthy armament suite for those ultra high value cargoes.

Built as an - excessive, according to some - response to prv Starworks's ongoing troubles with lost convoys, the Ilbud utilizes a sophisticated phase system to ensure that it will not be detected, intercepted, or destroyed by anything but the most involved and capable opposition. Ruinously expensive from a credits per cargo-lightyear perspective the Ilbud nonetheless offers the ability to transport just about anything, to just about anywhere, past just about anyone.

Neither pirates nor pathers nor heat nor gloom of space stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.",,,,
prv_munsbit,SHIP,"The infamous egg. Munsbit freighters are small and reasonably economical freighters produced by the prv to cover their domestic transportation needs. Serving as an officer on one of these mundane ships tends to mark the end of a career, rather than the beginning of one.

While feared and loathed by the prv officer corps, the ship is incredibly popular with the rank and file - as a dedicated freighter the ship is unlikely to see direct combat, and the crew compartment is surprisingly large and comfortable. It is not uncommon for service placements on a Munsbit to be grey-market traded for several credits.",,,,

### prv Fighters,,,,,,
#############################,,,,,,
prv_skran,SHIP,"Heavy interceptor focused on destroying other fighters. Armed with a single Akers heavy gun repeater and equipped with a Energized Reactive Field that can be activated to zap any hostile craft in extreme proximity.

Originally concepted as a ”one shot, one kill” platform, a full-size h41-calibre gun sadly proved too unweildy to fit on a fighter. The scaled-down version, while still punchy, falls short of the original goal. Nonetheless shielded or lightly armored fighters suffer greatly in combat with the Skrän.

While intended only for fighter combat there has still been found a need for the Skrän to do point-defense work, which neccessitated a crash program to update the fighter's targeting systems. Still, due to the cannon’s low rate of fire Skrän doctrine is to only target missiles if no other targets are available.

Later models of the Skrän have been upgraded with fighter-scale Energized Reactive Field emitters that build up immense potential differences between the craft and its environment. Once charged, the field needs just the slightest suggestion of contact in order to to reach out and equalize the potential - which takes the form of a powerful energy jolt, capable of destroying missiles and seriously harming other fighters and light ships.",,,,
prv_ovasen,SHIP,"Advanced companion fighter which harasses the enemy with a clutch of scaled-down Skata missiles. Also carries an extended-range Punktskydd cannon for use against hostile fighters and missiles. 

The hull is protected by a narrow but reliable omni-shield generator and two layers of duranium-hallbar plating. A magazine of additional missiles is located under the cockpit and is accessed continually while the supplies last.

Expensive to replace and manned by a crew of two, operators are strongly encouraged to only deploy their Oväsen wings in close coordination with friendly ships.",,,,
prv_diskordant,SHIP,"Strike fighter armed with a pair of Light Spattergun plasma projectors. This mobile craft swoops in and drenches its target in volleys of superheated plasma.

The cockpit, engine and critical machinery are protected by an ablative armor plating that can be replaced in a manner of seconds, something necessitated by the Spatterguns infamous tendency to cover every available surface with burning death.

Early models carried a full-scale Spattergun, but unmanageable levels of splashback damage forced development of a scaled down version. Diskordant pilots passing through the Ryak High Energy Labs are fond of showing off the station museum's fighter prototype to anyone willing to get roped in. It's mostly holes.",,,,
prv_missljud,SHIP,"Built to distract and disable enemy point defense and interceptors, the Missljud attacks its target with short-range EMP missiles. The otherwise delicate drone is protected by a reliable omni-shield, allowing it to soak a fair amount of enemy firepower.

This unmanned craft's purpose is to enhance the performance of other fighters by overloading or just outright absorbing hostile firepower. The Blåmes SRM, while lacking a breaching charge, is highly capable of disabling any electronics near the point of impact.",,,,
prv_oklang,SHIP,"Fragile attack drone armed with a focusing beam laser in a rotating housing. Opting for offense over defense, they carry a subspace-rending charge on a dead man’s trigger and only minimal defenses. Oklang are normally operated in large wings as heavy materiel losses are to be expected.

While the drone itself is easy to manufacture, producing LPCs for this fighter has proven difficult, with low yields and a high refuse rate. As such, availability is highly limited and it’s more common to hardwire a bay nanoforge with the pattern - or to simply use a sector-standard model, such as a Wasp or Talon, instead.",,,,
prv_skral,SHIP,"Torpedo bomber with a twin-mounted powered launch system similar to that found in the Kaja-family missiles. Skrål strikes are frighteningly swift.

Formally the Plasma Burn system is only supposed to be engaged when the fighter is in final approach for the bombing run, but endemic recklessness among prv fighter pilots and the general stresses of combat mean Skråls tend to burn early and often. When proper procedures are actually followed, a near-instant strike can be executed from, in the words of one Hegemony captain, a ”highly concerning” distance.",,,,
prv_jammer,SHIP,"This strike craft launches a velocity-boosted torpedo at its target and then follows the attack up with a blast from a fragmenting particle beam. Deadly against unshielded targets. 

The beam is highly effective against other fighter craft and can also be used to clear the way for a strike, should there be a defensive screen. The Jämmer only carries enough capacitors for two Fräsar-bursts however, potentially leaving it without any follow-up to the torpedo attack.",,,,
prv_stillhet,SHIP,"Sophisticated fighter with a phase system and a bevy of light energy weapons. Its durable armor provides it with reliable protection against kinetic attacks.

Piloting the Stillhet is a tremendous experience - Between the wash of the largely unshielded phase coils and the fully g-isolated cockpit that, from the pilot's perspective, lets the entire craft rotate around them, little else compares. These exertions mean that once the crew are back on the carrier and the combat stims wear off, drug-induced calm and focus turns into nausea, which is quickly followed by exhaustion and sudden deep sleep as the brain tries to deal with the intense overstimulation of rapid phase shifting and intense maneuvering in zero-g. prv Stillhet pilots in active service are required to adhere to a strict drug regimen and have their health monitored closely by ship doctors. 

In spite of Stillhet jocks being generally well-respected and compensated, once discharged from service and left to their own devices former crew show a disturbing tendency to turn to drug use and danger-seeking habits. Fewer than half are still alive and living unassisted after a decade.",,,,

The SIPD is capable of targeting missiles, but performs better against fighters and frigates. The fire control logic is wired accordingly, and captains concerned about strike weapons would do well to combine the laser with more traditional point defense weapons.

Field experience with the SIPD has shown that the system benefits greatly from after-market enhancements such as accelerated turret gyros or focusing array replacements, ensuring that it can start focusing the beam early and keep it on target reliably. At the same time such enhancements tend to increase the size of the weapon significantly - removing one of its main virtues, the unintrusive and easy-to-maintain weapon mounting.",Close Defense,,,
prv_jursla,WEAPON,"This heavy graviton beam is used to guide energy blasts towards the target. The ceaseless particle bombardment is a significant threat to any shield emitter.

Surfing on the outside of the beam walls, the graviton packets smoothly oscillate towards the target following sophisticated EM principles that are, for once, well understood even in the degraded Persean sector.

The Magnetdestabiliserad plasmaprojekteringskanon - Spattergun in common parlance - spreads superheated unfocused plasma over a wide area, melting even combat armor plating. Due to the short maximum range operators are adviced to be very aware of the splashback potential. 

A simple implementation of what was originally a very large and complicated weapon, the Spattergun is derived from early and ill-fated attempts to construct a capital-scale shield-bypassing energy weapon. After throwing out essentially all the complicated parts - sophisticated power banks, omnifocal photon focusing arrays, ultramagnetic field generators, and so on - the principles behind a practical and efficient energy blaster could be found under the dross of ineffective hypertechnology.",General (Area),,,

prv_lpk,WEAPON,"Guided particle pulse launcher firing from capacitor banks that recharge faster at high flux levels. Its energy blasts are flux-efficient and homing, but also tend to be somewhat unstable and will dissipate if subjected to accurate point-defense fire.

By utilizing a complicated passive flux shunt interface that gives maintenance engineers ulcers the LPK can achieve astounding power efficiencies. This comes at the cost of being unable to feed the weapon directly, instead having to rely on the entire main line load to achieve maximized recharge rates.

According to the technical manual the main flux shunt feedrate limiter should ”under no circumstances be removed, tampered with or otherwise modified”. It continues: ”Removal may induce recharge rates above component ratings, induction feedback loops, and other forms of enhanced performance”. The sector being what it is, intact LPK feedrate limiters have ended up being about as common as hen's teeth.",General,,,
prv_frasare,WEAPON,"The Fräsare tears up the space around its target with a smattering of subspace tearing. With an initial sharp kick and a rapid dropoff, this beam rips through poorly protected targets. 

While only achieving moderate effect on shields or heavy armor, the space-warping artifacts left behind by the beam quickly tear unprotected targets into shreds, scattering them over several dimensions. Professional opinions differ on whether the beam is truly effective, or merely horrifying.",Finisher (Area),,,
prv_svepfrasare,WEAPON,"Ripping space itself into shreds this particle beam calmly sweeps across the battlefield, which then erupts into countless blasts of subspace tearing. Lightly protected targets caught under the beam’s arc can expect to take heavy damage, if they are not destroyed outright. 

The sweep arc width is hard set on installation, and may end up reduced when installed into mounts which have only limited space to rotate the focusing sphere.

Volumes turned into boiling particle soup by a Fräsare keep emitting fission-signature radiation for decades after being first afflicted by the weapon - a curious property to say the least; how can there be nuclear reactions without matter?",Finisher (Area),,,
prv_ljungeld,WEAPON,"Devastating heavy particle beam that can partially bypass pressured shields. Has limited charges and a very slow recharge rate.

By creating and carefully maintaining a vortex feedback loop a standard shield can be induced to create local vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a sufficiently powerful beam emitter to break through the shield and arc to any massive matter present behind it.

Actually monitoring and nurturing these vulnerabilities is a task well beyond any human operator, or indeed most electronics. A (nominally) sub-gamma level AI is embedded in the power coil system of the weapon and ensures that optimal power levels and emission frequencies are maintained at all times.

The immense power of the beam emitter poses equally immense challenges for the power feed. which is based on a number of AI-monitored capacitor banks that must be maintained at very specific charge levels to enable to feedback loop to function.

The SIPD is capable of targeting missiles, but performs better against fighters and frigates. The fire control logic is wired accordingly, and captains concerned about strike weapons would do well to combine the laser with more traditional point defense weapons.

Field experience with the SIPD has shown that the system benefits greatly from after-market enhancements such as accelerated turret gyros or focusing array replacements, ensuring that it can start focusing the beam early and keep it on target reliably.

prv_akers_nova,WEAPON,"These long-range cannons fire ionized flechettes which are capable of overloading enemy shields by kinetic impact or disabling systems through EMP bursts. Ideal for shutting down shield-reliant targets.

prv Starworks' recent acquisition of the Ryak High-Energy Labs shaped the development of this youngest member of the Akers family. Little of the technology of its relatives remain, abandoning orthodox chemical propellants and rifled barrels in favor of an isolated-plasma rail system that can ionize and launch a shell twice as heavy as that of the Heavy Akers without any loss in velocity, offering improved kinetic performance and a strong EMP effect on hull strikes without having to rely on a fuzed charge. Improved ship sensors integration and a thorough overhaul of the control servomotors have also increased the accuracy of the system, especially during sustained fire.

This excellent performance improvement does however come at a price. The plasma rails and ionization vanes both draw significant amounts of extra power, leading the weapon to suffer in flux efficiency. It is also hell to maintain, requiring daily recalibration of the plasma field sensors and frequent replacement of abraded flux shunts and worn out plasma guide rails. Systems installation and grade 3+ service and repair work should only ever be done by a prv-certified technical team at a fully equipped spaceyard.

prv_akers_denova,WEAPON,"By giving up any pretense of efficiency these cannons manage to fire their bursting shells at an exceptional rate. The high flux load does however mean that the weapon challenges its operator as much as the target.

The shell’s subspace-tearing charge is a minor marvel, offering deadly effect on exposed targets. Regrettably the charges have a short shelf-life and are fairly difficult to produce, leading to shipside forges only managing to keep a limited amount in the magazines. 

Mechanically the gun is otherwise fairly traditional, with a tendency towards oversized and high-spec parts. Powerful but simple components define the weapon’s basic configuration.

The end result is a functional but painfully short-ranged weapon that does exhibit peculiar gravitic properties - though they are generally too unpredictable to be of much practical use. The saving grace for the project was that the resulting weapon is fairly cheap to produce and operate, while still managing good effect on ship armor.

It still carries a certain respect among the prv though, as it is well capable of shaking up a battlespace, opening up opportunities that can be exploited by fast ships and agile minds. And as one admiral remarked, ”a pulse laser cares little about gravity”.

Greatly feared by persean fighter jocks, fed by stories (and, for that matter, by bootleg combat footage) of pilots being hit by the gravblast and getting ejected from the battlefield in a disabled craft, never to be seen again.

Attempts to adapt the technology to kinetic weapons have proven fruitless, as the Studsare fundamentally works by ”skipping” the shell on the shield surface, making as little impact on the field itself as possible.

#prv_svala,WEAPON,"A light launcher for advanced guided torpedoes. As the Svala approaches its target the main torpedo splits into several submunitions which unleash energy blasts towards the target.

Conceptually the Svala torpedo disperses a number of scaled-down single-use anti-matter blasters, each of which contains a polarized-magfield generator plus capacitor, a powerful but short-lived set of orienting thrusters, and a shell filled with 1.42 micrograms of positron antimatter. The magfield is collapsed in the direction of the target, both triggering and orienting the blast towards its victim. An unfortunate compromise of the design is that the magfield generators have to operate disconnected from the main ship drawlines, necessitating a short delay to charge the on-board capacitors before the torpedo can be launched.

The intricate and valuable gun component of the Svala warhead is reusable, and a little over half of the owner/operator's manual covers search, recovery and refurbishment procedures. This has done little to help the system's reputation of being wastefully expensive and over-elaborate. The Ryak High-Energy Labs marketing department have given up on combating this characterization and now sell the weapon under the tagline ”Performance at any cost! - When it's your life that is on the line.” Obviously this has not been terribly persuasive when it comes to landing contracts with the Persean Armaments Committee.",Strike,,,

prv,FACTION,"For the upstarts and opportunists of the prv Starworks megacorporation the post-collapse era has been ripe with opportunity, a time where wealth and power is within reach of anyone brave enough to reach out and grasp it, hold it down, and make it his own. After a series of leveraged buyouts, hostile takeovers, and a few direct invasions, the prv has managed to carve out a fief of its own and is eyeing the post-collapse sector hungrily for any new opportunities for an ”acquisition”.

The Works, an orbital megafactory orbiting a backwards fringe world, form the heart of the corporation's power. There one of only a few still functioning nanoforges in the sector churns out ship after ship, squadron after squadron, fleet after fleet to allow the prv to challenge the sector for supremacy. The major powers are not entirely impressed however - what could a group of fringe-worlders hope to accomplish against the likes of the Hegemony? The prv seem to agree, and have pursued trade alliances with the neighboring powers of the Persean League and Sindrian Diktat. Haughtier voices in the inner sector have gone as far as to describe the relationship as ”tributary”.

Indeed the situation of the prv is not entirely clear-cut. While their industrial capacity is respectable and the corporation's navy grows stronger by the day, they lack military experience and have an unenviable strategic situation with vulnerable supply routes connecting far-flung and isolated assets.",,,,

prv_stjarngard_strand,CUSTOM,"Great waves of harmless golden sand punctuated by a occasional streams, lakes and even a few minor oceans make up the main geographical features on Strand. Sadly, the otherwise pleasant planet is completely bereft of valuable resources or significant soil nutrients and the population must make a living though trade and manufacturing.",,"While economically completely worthless - its main export would be silicate - the low gravity and almost comforting biosphere of Strand make it an ideal waystation for goods that would be expensive and difficult to process elsewhere. The prv Starworks Corporation have set up a major presence here, completely dominating local politics through a combination of gunboat diplomacy and monopolizing all spacebound logistics on the planet.",,
prv_stjarngard_strand_station,CUSTOM,"Perseiska Kompaniet is a vast prv trade house that considers Strand its private protectorate. They control the majority of all trade on the colony, and impose military protection in exchange for extortionate fees. Nothing gets done on Strand without Kompaniet getting its cut of the proceeds.",,"Luxuriously decorated, the lavish halls of the PK speak of great wealth, or possibly great insecurity. With all the good taste of a bank office and humility of an aristocrat’s mansion, the station’s environments are considered entirely insufferable by anyone not a Tri-Tachyon financier or prv noble. All in all it is the perfect place to exchange large sums of other people’s money.",,
prv_stjarngard_utbo,CUSTOM,"A large, mild eccentric world populated by millions of people who live quiet lives mainly as farmers under the thumb of a dizzying array of feudal lords. All legal trade with the world passes through the orbital station, leaving the planet itself largely isolated from the sector.",,"Time passes slowly in endless farmsteads, fishing villages and townships of Utbo. The farmers work the land, the lords skirmish amongst each other, and the corporation taxes. In the planetside port, a large armed garrison ensures that no visitors leave the trade city without a passport, and likewise that no unauthorized locals enter it.",,

In the towers residential sections are squeezed in between formal corporate offices and opulent trade houses. 

Salarymen walk the skybridges between the towers and cargo barges weave through the thin air and low gravity, delivering goods to wherever they are needed. Underneath the towers monorail trains move the industry laborers about through the din and clamor of the wharves and workshops. 

In the towers, ever-busy bureaucrats hurry through sedate parks and solemn office houses, while on the ring calm, collected workers carefully navigate a cacaphonous bustle of men and machines.",,

The Church of Galactic Redemption is highly influential on the planet, but have not yet managed to convince the populace to officially join Ludd's flock.",,"Visitors to the Fristad spaceport are greeted by two large tripedal skeletons with remarkably pointy teeth exhibited in the main hall, a poignant reminder that the local biohazard protocols are no joke. While most of the biosphere is benign and quite literally spineless, a few species of apex predators are more than capable of claiming unwary humans. A stall next to one of the specimens has a corporate suit selling dead peasants insurance to visiting captains, should any crew go missing during their stay. Realistically, the spacers’ bars claim significantly more lives - and the insurance covers that as well.",,
prv_kratul_rust_station,CUSTOM,"The largest mining station in the Kratul system, claimed sovereign by the miners and spacers who live and work there. An anarchic order is maintained by the local community militia, who generally end up sympathetic to the great man of the hour.",,"During the Domain the Kratul system was used as a scrapyard for ship hulks deemed to be of marginal economic interest. Over the centuries the salvage stocks built up, orbits decayed, and the whole mess got mixed into the asteroid belts of the system. Post-collapse, miners and salvagers make a good living recovering what, these days, are often regarded as perfectly good ships that just need some basic refurbishment.",,
prv_kratul_oy_station,CUSTOM,"Intended to supplement the Kratul II wharfs, the Outer Yards were a grandiose project meant to supply much of the demand for civilian ships in the ever-growing Persean sector. However the station was only halfway constructed at the time of the collapse, and today it sits still unfinished, sporting jutting support beams and abandoned construction equipment.",,"An ever-growing population of traders, miners and engineers live and work on the Outer Yard, making their livings off the generous amounts minerals and salvage brought back from the belt. Local society is largely syndicalist and basic law and order is maintained by a system of guild enforcers with each policing its own quarter of the station. Inter-syndicate conflicts are common, and often get inflamed but only rarely escalate into organized violence. Still, visitors are advised to not ask about the c194 incidents.",,
prv_kratul_kratul,CUSTOM,"The very face of industrial devastation, Kratul II's rimy and mountainous surface sports dozens of different types of ice - most highly toxic. An extensive mining industry and countless heavy manufactories have polluted freely over centuries and while the planet was never terribly habitable to begin with the post-collapse years have brought the environment to a point where walking the surface unprotected is regarded as, at best, unwise.",,"A popular pastime on Kratul is snipe-hunting. In this case, the snipe is an actual animal that lives and feeds on various chemical ices, metabolizing even the strangest toxins. Supposedly the species was bioengineered by a local potentate, who missed the post-burn hunts of his youth on Jangala. Reportedly the snipe is very difficult prey - quick, clever, and so tough that ”it doesn't die even if you kill it”.",,
prv_kratul_kratul_station,CUSTOM,"One of the largest and oldest spacewharfs in the Persean Sector. In the pre-collapse era it was to be one of the primary manufacturing locations for Skymning-class battleships, a large number of which have been laid down and then left to rust unfinished at anchorpoints slowly orbiting the station.",,"When the light is just right a visitor can look out one of the station's massive panorama windows and see the dozens of battleship hulls anchored around the wharf.

The buildings are pitted and scarred from corrosive rains, and the sea platforms seem to be crumbling underneath your feet. Every person you can see moving about is wearing hazmat scrubs. The lone saving grace is the pleasant temperature of the acidic seabreeze.",,
