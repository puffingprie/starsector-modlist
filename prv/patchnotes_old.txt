####

v10:

COMPATABILITY NOTE: 
A new campaign is required for several new features, most notably the Rust Belt faction.

Added the Rust Belt faction
- A loose confederation of usually-not-quite-pirates operating on the fringe of the sector. Fond of salvaging and restoring lost ships, for sale or use.
-- Ruster markets occasionally spawn pirate fleets. Travelers, beware.
-- Most Pirate (prv) ships and weapons have been reassigned to the Rusters.

Added the Kratul system
- Hiding in the never-ending iron-oxide asteroid fields and Dominion-era scrapyard dumping grounds of the Kratul belts lie the Great Belt Alliance, or more commonly Rusters. Miners, salvagers, occasionally pirates and generally free spirits the Rusters have ended up in a violent vendetta with the intractable prv's industrial world of Kratul II.

Added the Raider Hideout, Armed Community and War Syndicate HQ industries
- Rust Belt markets with one of these industries will generate Pirate fleets.
-- If the RB are at not at peace with the Pirates, additional RB fleets will spawn instead.
-- Corvus-mode pre-placed only, for the moment.

Added the Flock Light Missile Cruiser
- Fragile craft equipped with a unique automatic missile launcher that can fire prodigious amounts of Kråka missiles.
- Also comes in Midrange and Rust Belt variants:
-- Midrange: Unlocks the middle Large Missile mount and comes with fast missile racks. Very volatile.

- Small civilian craft with a flexible drone bay and a frigate-size salvage gantry.

Added the Basalt Heavy Frigate
- A sturdy brawling ship with a cheap support profile that is popular in the belt.

Added the Visent Frontier Freighter
- Barely larger than a frigate, the Visent still carries everything you need to haul cargo on the fringes of the sector - including guns and armor. Boasts an excellent top speed, but it's held back by poor acceleration and agility.

Added the Middag, Fika and Munsbit freighters
- Ranging from large and heavily armed to small and mostly harmless these transports take on a variety of hauling jobs for the prv corporation.
- Carry a number of semi-autonomous gun pods.

Added the Kakafoni (RB) skin
- Pirate version, but with a burn drive.
- Kakafoni (P) spawn rate greatly reduced.

Added the Skarn Strike Fighter
- Quick strike craft which strafes the target with an AKC chaingun, inflicting significant kinetic damage.

Added the Buddy Utility Craft

Updated the Siege Akers (Prototype) codex graphic.

Skrän fighter
- Increased damage and rate of fire on the Microjursla.
- Added new system, Energized Reactive Field. Zaps any hostiles in very close proximity to the fighter for minor energy damage.

####

v4.1

Included missing Tystnad sprite update.

####

v4:
Added the Tystnad (P) skin.
	A far more offensively inclined variant.
	Rebuilt to take any fighter wing. Phase Recall system replaced with Reserve Deployment. 
	Small mount arcs greatly narrowed, rear pair now point forwards. Synergy and Hybrid mounts downgraded, new setup is 1x Med Missile, 1x Med Ballistic, 2x Small Ballistic, 2x Small Energy.
	Flown by Pirates and less scrupulous Salvagers and Independents.
	Adjusted Tystnad occurence rates.
	"Pirate" variant is available to fight in the simulator.

Added the Ljus (LP) skin
	Operates as a strike frigate. Can fire its Hammers at a frightening rate, so be careful.
	Nose mount replaced by a custom Hammer launcher with an 8-shot magazine. Mounts otherwise as on the (D) model.
	Lykta system replaced by Fast Missile Racks.
	Standard LP hullmods.
	Flown by the Luddic Path.
	
Ljus (D) Hammer and Rocket variants trade in their Safety Overrides for additional flux vents and capacitors, making them significantly less obnoxious.
Ljus Ambush variant switches its Dual Light Autocannon (and a vent) for an Akers.

Updated Punktskydd and Punktskydd Cluster graphics - now a pleasant ballistic tan.

Fusion Burst Laser role description changed from "Strike" to "Assault".
The AI will now consider the FBL a strike weapon, and keep it in reserve until it has a clear shot on armor or hull.
Corrected error in FBL autofit weighting.

Various fleet integration adjustments. Most notably, reduced occurence rate of Ljus in independent fleets by roughly a third.

Corrected error in description of the Degraded Lykta System. Now correctly states that it reduces, not increases, sensor strength while active.

####

v3:
Added the Tystnad light destroyer.
	A high-tech support ship with a single locked-in wing of Ovasen fighters. Light armaments, good mobility, reasonable protection but low hull integrity. Expensive to operate for its size.
	Excellent potential as a PD-boat.
	Flown by the Independents, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and the Persean League.
	
Added the Ovasen companion fighter.
	Only found integrated into Tystnad light destroyers.
	Agile and well-protected fighters which defend their escort target with an extended-range Punktskydd cannon and harrass nearby enemies with modified Skata missiles.

Adjusted faction fleet preferences to integrate the Tystnad.

Updated the graphics of the Ljus and Ljus D. They should now be considerably less busy.

Added a surface map to the Ljus and Ljus D. Look out for the pretty lights on the Lykta antennas.

Akers
	New sprite - now a more traditional tan gun mount.
	Adjusted projectile trail color.
	Adjusted lighting effects.
	Now has a 20% chance to create a minor EMP arc on hull hits.
Heavy Akers
	New sprite - now a more traditional tan gun mount.
	Adjusted projectile trail color.
	Adjusted lighting effects.
	Now has a 33% chance to create a small EMP arc on hull hits.
	Reduced range from 700 to 675.
Akers Nova
	Now has a 50% chance to create a significant EMP arc with a minor damage component (10% as energy) on hull hits.
	Rate of fire reduced by 15%.
	Adjusted lighting effects.

These changes were made to make the Akers family more visually interesting and to further differentiate them from Autocannons and Needlers.

Kaja, Kraka
	AI will now use these against frigates more aggressively.
	
I mean, it's not like they're gonna run out.
	
Korp
	AI will now use it more aggressively against frigates.
	Tier increased from 2 to 3.
	Rarity modifier increased from 0.65 to 1.
	
Fits the tier 3 spot better than the Skata.

Skata
	Missiles will now be more randomly distributed within the cone of fire.
	Increased number of missiles per salvo from 30 to 45.
	Increased ammunition from 180 to 270.
	Reduced burst refire delay from 0,3 to 0,2.
	Reduced damage per shot from 300 to 225.
	Reduced projectile hitpoints from 75 to 65.
	Corrected transparency error in main graphic.
	OVerhauled turret base graphic.
	Tier reduced to 2.
	Rarity modifier reduced to 0.5.
	
This was mostly an aesthetic change with only minor gameplay implications. Skata volleys will now gum up PD a little better, and deal a little more damage on shields and hull. Performance against heavy armor will suffer somewhat. Tier was reduced since simply painting your missiles yellow doesn't actually make them high tech (you have to use blue paint for that).

Improved automatic fitting ranks - Autofit should work better now.

Mora (LP)
	Now correctly named "Mora (LP)".

Punktskydd
	Tweaked flak cloud visual effect.
	Corrected codex typo.
	
Pynktskydd Cluster
	Range increased from 600 to 700.
	Fuzes now have a chance of detonating early.
	Tweaked flak cloud visual effect.
	
Broadsword (LP)
	Corrected codex typo, minor wording changes.

####

v2 rc1:

added Mora (LP) carrier skin
Used by the Luddic Path, and, less commonly, the Luddic Church.

added Broadsword (LP) bomber
added Talon (LP) interceptor

Updated Luddic Church and Luddic Path ship selection: they now also fly Ljus (D), Mora (LP), and Dominator (D) ships. This greatly improves the selection in Path military markets.

Added the Mora (LP) Great Struggle to the simulator
Removed the Wolf Kaja, Gryphon Corvid, Ljus (D) Hyperspace Lizard and Ljus Kinetic Support variants from the simulator.

Known issues: Broadsword (LP) and Talon (LP) LPCs look extremely similar to Broadsword and Talon LPCs in the market. Suggested workaround is simply mousing over them to see which is which.

####

v1 rc5
Initial Release
