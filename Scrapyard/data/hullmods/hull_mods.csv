Anomalous IPDAI,sa_puppetmaster,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.sa_puppetmaster,"A unique modification to the Integrated Point Defense AI that appears to carry the same benefits as the original, but bizarrely this AI appears to enhance automated targeting systems as well as locating weakpoints in wings and missiles to exploit, though these upgrades come at  cost, such modifications have resulted in electrical components burning out faster, increasing the rate at which repairs are needed.",,graphics/hullmods/puppetmaster.png
Lobster Breeding Tanks,sa_lobster_tanks,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.sa_lobster_tanks,"The central core of the Ebirah, a network of complex aquatic tanks perfectly replicate the depths of Volturn, allowing volturnian lobster onboard to be stored without cryogenic freezing, and with excess food reserves onboard, the crew can actually coax the lobster into breeding, allowing for essentially a portable lobster farm with weekly reports on the food and lobster aboard. Onboard Volturnian Lobster are noted to experience a spawning season corresponding to the Old Earth months from April to ending in July.",,graphics/hullmods/lobster_breeding.png
Defiled Fourteenth Battlegroup,Fourteenth_defiled,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.Fourteenth_defiled,"While a semblance of the proud Domain heritage exists within the armor and surviving flux banks, the immense modifications have forever tainted and degraded those upgrades into a rough semblance of what they once were, and a grim reminder of the entropy of time.",,graphics/hullmods/defiled_fourteenth.png
Automated Subsystems,sa_automated_subsystems,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.sa_automated_subsystems,"An extensive network of failsafes and redundant bypass networks run throughout the hull of this ship, linked to a ""sub gamma"" control system. A number of the modifications behave similar to standard hardened subsystem techniques, but leave no room for further reinforcements to the systems. The automation procedures have resulted in largely reduced crew requirements as well.",,graphics/hullmods/sa_automated_subsystems.png
Refined Targeting Core,sa_refined_targeting_core,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.sa_refined_targeting_core,"An antiquated but efficient targeting computer originally intended to pinpoint mineral rich clusters, careful tuning and the bypassing of a few software components has produced a combat ready system that can outclass modular hull packages, but falls short of dedicated systems.",,graphics/hullmods/refined_targeting_core.png
