Plasma Coupling,dpl_plasmacoupling,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_PlasmaCoupling,"The beam weapons on this ship are coupled with the plasma damage, resulting in dealing hard flux to shields.",Makes beam weapon deal hard flux,graphics/hullmods/dpl_plasma_coupling.png
Mega Positronium Linac,dpl_megalinac,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_Mega_Linac,The energy weapons on this ship has direct supplies of particles and energy from the mega positronium linac. Resulting in fire rate of energy weapons increaced by %s,Makes energy weapon fire more frequently,graphics/hullmods/dpl_megalinac.png
Emergency Forge,dpl_emergency_forge,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_EmergencyForge,This ship has a special torus of phase cavities to store incredible amount of active nano particles. The nano particles can be released from the phase storage to do a one time rapid field repairs by reconstructing the ship using the nano particles. The hull would be fixed to %s of the max hull points. All flux would be released by throwing away the flux conductors and reconstruct new ones. And doing so would cost %s of max CR,Revives the ship at lowered hullpoints and decreased CR for once,graphics/hullmods/dpl_emergency_forge.png
Energy Rangefinder,dpl_energy_rangefinder,2,,Domain Phase Lab,"offensive, merc, standard",Weapons,8000,,,,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.dpl_EnergyRangefinder,<tooltip created in the script due to lots of highlighting>,Increases base range of small and medium weapons in energy slots.,graphics/hullmods/dpl_energy_rangefinder.png
Phase Integration,dpl_phase_integration,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_PhaseIntegration,This ship is integrated with the phase space through the phase resonance achieved by a fractal phase coil. Reduces phase cooldown by %s. Reduces the phase cloak's activation cost to %s. Scales the soft flux dissipation and weapon recharge rate by factor of %s while phased.,Reduces phase cloak cooldown. Deminishes dissipation and increases phase time speed-up factor,graphics/hullmods/dpl_phase_integration.png
Phase Projection,dpl_phase_projection,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_PhaseProjection,"This ship is the projection of some phase space entity. As long as the entity survives and the acausal path between the phase space and the physical space continues to exist. So this ship can always revive. 

**You heard a voice from deep void outside your vessel: Poor being, have you lost your soul in chasing for the power? You may used your power to capture this poor projection from the existence of my wrath, but no, my vengeance for the lost souls in your saturate bomb shall not, not ever be aside with you. But please, please come back, captain, if your soul is still alive and can hear, I forgot my name, and I'm about to disappear, but I remembered you, and I must leave my last words. Even if it's already too late, if you were in this situation, you must have some ways to save us all. What happened broke my heart, it must have been some ghost of madness that took control of your body, and I must save you by destroying that evil existence, please forgive me, and continue your jour...** The voice dies down.",Revives the ship ,graphics/hullmods/dpl_phase_projection.png
Modulized Shield,dpl_modulizedshield,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_ModulizedShields,"This ship has compact shield modules, it makes the ship impossible to install other shield generators. Such design has advantage that the shields are less affected by the ship's plasma cores and have independent flux status. But whenever each module is destroyed, its explosion will also cause great amount damage to the ship.",Install shields as independent modules,graphics/hullmods/dpl_modulized_shields.png
Phase Coil Extension,dpl_phase_extension,3,,Domain Phase Lab,"req_spaceport, phase, no_build_in, special",Phase,15000,,,,15,20,25,35,data.hullmods.dpl_ExtendedCoils,"Phase coils are less able to maintain a connection with normal space as the ship's hard flux levels rise, resulting in a greatly reduced top speed as the coils struggle to gain traction.

By making fractal extensions of the phase coils into the ship hull, the threshold at which speed bottoms out can be increased by %s. For standard-design coils with no other modifications, this takes the threshold from %s to %s. This hull mod is compatible with all other hullmods, but can't be built-in.",Reduces impact of hard flux level on top speed while phased.,graphics/hullmods/dpl_phase_coils_extended.png
Entangled Systems,dpl_entangled_systems,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_EntangledSystem,"As a complicated experimental platform, all ship systems on this ship are entangled. If the ship has a D-Mod, all systems on the ship will be affected and the mote induction process will be disturbed. Resulting in a %s penalty on the ship's damage.","If the ship has any D-Mod, it will suffer a damage penalty.",graphics/hullmods/detach_never.png
Special Hanger,dpl_special_hanger,5,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_SpecialHanger,"The fighter bays on this craft are specialized to support Domain Phase Lab fighters, and it cannot support fighters with other designs that cost more than 15 ordinary points.",Specialized bays for Domain Phase Lab fighters.,graphics/hullmods/dpl_special_hanger.png
Target Analysis System,dpl_energy_charger,,,Domain Phase Lab,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.dpl_EnergyCharger,"The ship has an advanced device that helps the weapon operators perform target analysis when firing, increases ship's all weapon damage and reloading time both by %s. The effect of this device can be greatly enhanced if the ship has phase coils, so the weapon damage effect is doubled for phase ships.

""Ready! Aim! Fire!""",Increase weapon damage and reloading time.,graphics/hullmods/dpl_energy_charger.png
