They have left the system with various vessels, we tried to intercept, but most of them still jumped out of the system. We have also received a report of sighting a strange spherical ship from an exploratory fleet. That fleet lost connection after making the report.""

She took a deep breath: ""And, for the more concerning part, we finally broke some of the Nelson's most complicated encryptions, and it shows us that he had stolen an extremely dangerous ship design called Theater Organ years ago. The shape of the spherical ship in the report matches almost exactly with the shape of this design.

This is a serious matter.""

She looks into your eyes: ""And, for the ship Theater Organ, it's a flying moon, that can fire deadly plasma rays powerful enough, comparable to a planet killer, to destroy a planet on full charge. That ship is like a doom star. I canceled its development once the prototype finished its firing experiment. Such design is, afterall, too unnecessarily dangerous.

And what could serve this purpose better than vaporizing a planet with almost all populations in this sector?
