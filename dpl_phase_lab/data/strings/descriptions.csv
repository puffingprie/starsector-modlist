dpl_phase_lab,FACTION,"The Phase Lab is a faction formed by a military research institute working for domain navy that focused on studies of phase space, known as the Domain Phase Lab, that got lost in the Orion-Perseus abyss during the collapse. Due to the nature of abyss, and lack of fuel, it took them two centuries to travel out of the abyss and fly to the core worlds. They had some encounters with the drone ship fleets that took away many lives, and so this caused their decade-long hostility against the Tri-Tachyon corporation. The Phase Lab has tens of million of populations, mostly scientists, navy crews, and other people providing necessary supplies. The Phase Lab keeps the ranks of officers as they were in the domain navy, but the new-born citizens could only get enlisted in the Phase Lab navy, instead of the Domain Navy. As a faction, the Phase Lab cares about the livings of civilians, and the researches about the phase space.

The Phase Lab is a peaceful faction that tends to solve problems through diplomacy, and they declared full respect to other factions' power of regulation. The civilian organization is quite relaxed, as long as no extreme violations to the domain regulation policies, the civilians could freely act accoridng to their wills. However, the Phase Lab Navy completely follows the Domain Navy Articles of War, which is much more strict. The Phase Lab keeps a democratic structure when making decisions. All important decisions must pass the examination of the committee board before being valid, then the Chief Researcher (the leader of the Phase Lab) would execute the decisions. Exceptional times require exceptional measures, and so the Phase Lab also joins trading to raise fundings to support their research projects.",,,,
dpl_fluxdisruptor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly overloads an enemy ship that's really close.

The disruptor system developped by the phase lab. It creates a very narrow phase burst using a special independent phase coil called phase resonator. Its principle to work is complicated. In simple words, when activated, this system recursively charges the phase coil so that it resonates with the phase space, then it pushes a sudden energy burst in to destabilize the resonance state, this will cause a large fluctuation called phase burst in the phae space, and generate a lot of flux in the phase resonator. The resultant phase burst travels for very short range and can only affect one selected target. But if it hits a ship, no matter the ship lives in phase space or physical world, it will definitely overload all systems of the target for a minute.",Offensive,Briefly overloads an enemy ship that's really close.,,
dpl_phase_lightning,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Fires phase lightening that deals energy and emp damage to nearby enemy ships.

The phase lightning system is an emp striking system developped by the phase lab. It creates powerful lightning strikes by creating large charge clusters in a phase bubble and extracting arcs of energy out from the phase bubble to fire. The phase lightnings contains more energy than normal emp arcs, and so it travels slightly longer distance, and deals more damage to targets.",Special,Fires phase lightening that deals energy and emp damage to nearby enemy ships.,,

dpl_plasma_lance,WEAPON,"Plasma lance is a portable weapon system developped by the phase lab. It's a innovative weapon that's some what similar to combination of phase lance and plasma cannon. The phase lab uses a small phase coil that creates a small phase bubble inside the weapon cavity, and uses the phase bubble as a trapping cavity to concentrate plasmas. It turns out that plasmas don't like to stay together if you just simply pile them together in a phase bubble, and so this phenomena makes the weapon fire bursts of plasma beams instead of concentrated plasma clusters. There are rumors saying that the phase lab is trying to solve this problem by doing more careful studies on plasma flow structure, but all related information is classified.",,,,

dpl_trebel,WEAPON,"Trebel is an integrated experimental weapon system inspired by the concept 'Energy Torpedo'. The phase space has property of flux-insulation, and the phase lab sees opportunity inside: If one can maintain a bubble in phase space, and squeeze as much energy as possible into that bubble, when the bubble destabilizes, the insulated energy released could be as deadly as a reaper torpedo.

The result of such improvement is Longinus, an integrated energy torpedo system that is even more deadly than Gungnir, its phase-compressed plasma shots deals pure energy damage, but when it hits armor, as the phase glube destabilizes, rapid expansion of the compressed plasma would cause extra explosion. It takes so much energy and generates so much heat to fire, that a new ship is needed just to operate this weapon system.",,,,
dpl_gungnir,WEAPON,"Latest studies on subatomic structures leads to new possibilities in phase compression technology. The phase lab discovers that if some plasma were put into the phase glube at first, then it is possible for the compressed energy to form shell like structure around the plasma kernel, making the plasma cluster denser and hotter. When the phase glube destablizes, the plasma cluster will greatly expand, causing huge explosions. So Trebel can be greatly improved with help of this idea.

The most amazing ability of this weapon comes with the repeling nature of electrons: it contains so much charge that the lightning arcs generates secondary and tertiary arcs when hitting targets, and the generated arcs does the same amount of damage, within shorter range.

dpl_hdpl,WEAPON,"The high density plasma lance is a portable weapon system developped by the phase lab. It's the mature product developped from the prototype gungnir. By rapidly firing a sequence of phase glubes containing compressed energy-plasma complex, this weapon is ablt to produce a beam of dense plasmas in short time, but it takes time to charge. Same as gungnir, the compressed energy-plasma complex still causes explosion when it hits armor, but the beam nature of the shots makes the overall damage behavior of the weapon closer to a beam of plsama, i.e. it mainly deals energy damage for now.",,,,
dpl_lightning_lance,WEAPON,"A burst beam of charges that delivers a devastating amount of damage with a cascading EMP component. When it hits shields, some EMP arcs will be generated inside of the shield, and would directly hit the hull. Though the damages of the EMP arcs would be greatly reduced.

The Phase Charge Lance uses core technology based on the principles of an experimental interstellar electricity transport system developped by the phase lab. The system uses a phase cavity as a gate to connect the physical universe and the phase space. Then by using phase resonance phenomenon, it creates charged beams that travel in phase space for a certain range. The beam would destabilize once it hits objects in the physical universe or it reaches its maximum range. When it destablizes, the charges would be released from the phase space, and travel to the objects nearby creating arcs.

Due to cost reasons, this experimental interstellar electricity transport system did not get widely used in the domain sectors. But the destablization process gives this weapon a very interesting 'shield penetrating' property. Since if the beam hits shields, the charges would be released in front of the hitting point, and so the arcs would be generated inside the shield, hitting the hull as if the shield does not block the charge arcs. And so this property makes the electricity transport system into a good weapon.",,,,
dpl_chants,WEAPON,"A perfect example of the combination of hyper-physics theory with graviton weapon technologies.

dpl_plasma_hammer,WEAPON,"The plasma hammer is a portable weapon system developped by the phase lab. It's the mature product developped from the prototype longinus. By compressing less plasma into each phase glube, the total amount of plasma needed to generate a shot is greatly reduced, and the preparation time is shorter. But its principle to work is the same as longinus, and so the shots still causes explosion when they hit on armor.",,,,
dpl_hymn,WEAPON,"Hymn is a mature integrated weapon system developped by the phase lab. It was one of the first works of the phase lab, made in the early days far before the persean sector was colonized. Its working principle is simple: use great amount of energy to run pair production process, separate the electrons and positrons using a magnetic field. Then store those particles in phase cavities to build up the density. When firing, the particles will be released, the cyclotrons will accelerate them, and a linac will direct all those particles at enemy ship. When this ray of positrons and electrons hit target, the positroniums will undergo annihilation, and surviving electrons could build up charge gradient to disturb shields. It can't be made into a portable weapon system, because it requires 70% of the energy generated by a capital ship reactor to power up, and so it's only mounted on battleships specially designed to carry this weapon.",,,,

dpl_hydraulis,SHIP,"Hydraulis is an experimental product of the phase lab, she is a test platform for the weapon system called 'Notes'. The Notes weapon system is so large that it takes a cruiser sized ship to carry, and a capital sized ship to power.

So Hydraulis is the answer from the lab: a cruiser sized moving reactor with Notes system. Phase cloak system is not applicable due to its energy cost, and merely no armor can be installed without severly slowing the ship down.

Thus a shield generator is used instead, with special modifications done to further protect this vulnerable ship, and a fighter bay is installed to provide additional protection and support.

dpl_hydraulis_notes,WEAPON,"Notes is a miracle of the phase technology. The phase lab discovered that given high enough energy input, deep coupling between phase space and physical space can be triggered, and this process sometimes produces flying 'motes' that has certain affinity to physical objects. The phase lab seeks to couple these motes with phase compressed energy glubes, creating a guided energy torpedo system. It turns out that such further coupling is very unlikely to happen in the first place, and the energy in the phase glube can't be too large, or the 'motes' will be burned before the coupling. But when the 'motes' are coupled with phase glubes, the motes will absorb the energy, gain higher frequency and start burning, they are deadly shots until they burn out. Afterall, Notes is the result, a huge guided torpedo launcher with small number of slowly-reproducible shots, each has low damage, but long range.",,,,

Such a role is critical when countering large scale pirate armadas and terrorism attacks. And so sarrusophone is the result, she has more concentrated frontal turrets, and a lot of defensive turrets to deal with fighter attacks.

The phase lab also installed a hymn weapon system to strengthen her assult power, at the cost of weakening her shield strength.",,,,
dpl_aulochrome,SHIP,"The aulochrome is one of the few early phase lab designs that were successfully recovered when the phase lab arrived in the sector.

She was designed at the same time as conquest when the cruiser school was a popular idea in the domain of men navy. Her role in the fleet is best described by the concept of a 'fast battleship', a capital ship that has stronger firepower than battle cruisers and higher speed than battleships.

At that time, the phase lab made a built in emergency forge system that stores nanoforge particles using the phase space, and this system allows battle ships to be reconstructed for once in the middle of space battles. The domain of men navy was highly interested in the military potential of such system, and started cooperation of designing this warship with the phase lab. 

Aulochrome is the result: a deadly and fast battleship equipped with the emergency forge system. Domain navy also installed the best targeting core and military shield they could offer at that time on the ship. She served as the flagship in the phase lab escort fleets during the deployment of the phase lab to the persean sector.",,,,

dpl_cimbasso,SHIP,"The cimbasso is a a dreadnought-sized fortress carrier designed in the very early days of the phase lab. Her phase-enhanced shield system is very special: by disabling the weapons and directing all the fluxes generated by the shield system into a torus of phase cavities, the shield efficiency could be diminished. The cost is that the phase cavities would slowly generate hard flux. 

Unfortunately, after the ramming of the [REDACTED] drone ship, the blue print for the original design of cimbasso was partially lost, but its shield design was recovered. The the phase lab engineers took the chance to recover the blueprint as an opportunity to make improvements.

They came up with ideas to utilize the flux energy trapped in the phase cavity torus: to release the heat and generate thermal electricity, and use those electric charges to power phase lightning cannons mounted on the circuit. The result of this recovery, or improvement, is the cimbasso design nowadays.",,,,
dpl_oracle,WEAPON,"Oracle is one of the most advanced creation ever made by anything in the sector, its possibility to exist is already beyond imagination. Though it takes extremely long time to prepare all the plasma needed to charge up, the cost is always worthy for bringing the ultimate sword of destruction down to the earth. The phase lab constructed a micro version of a star gate to maintain a capital ship sized gigantic phase cavity. By compressing crazy amount of dense plasma into the cavity, eventually a micro version of a star would form inside the phase cavity. Finally, the phase lab used a micro version of cronal hypershunt to extract huge plasma streams out of this micro star in the phase cavity. At this stage the phase destabilization is not important anymore, for the super hot plasma stream is already deadly enough by itself.",,,,

The micro star gate acts as a gigantic phase cavity, it's also the gate connecting the physical world and the phase space, so it could also serve as a huge phse coil for the ship, with longer time to cooldown than normal ones. 

The Phase Lab only made one experimental prototype of this ship, and due to its dangerous nature, it was deconstructed once the firing experiment of the Oracle system was successful. 

Its temporary blue print was permanently deleted, but somehow an illegal copy was made and brought out from the Phase Lab. This ship was constructed in a nameless factory according to the illegal copy.",,,,

dpl_acausal_shock,WEAPON,"An impossible experimental weapon system that was produced before the phase lab was deployed to the persean sector. It uses causal principles to create phase shocks that can overload power grids. In simple words, it disrupts the phase space structure, like manually creating an earth-quake in the phase space, by forming resonance with the scope of phase space near this weapon and pumping energy into the phase space to extend the hidden micro-dimensions. Then the created extra dimensions will collapse due to their unstable nature, creating an anomaly called phase shock, and would generate incredible amount of zero point energy with flux. The creation and elimination of the extra dimensions depends heavily on the causal structures of the space-time continuum, and so this weapon is called causal shock emitter. ",,,,
dpl_phase_mg,WEAPON,"An impossible experimental weapon system that was produced before the phase lab was deployed to the persean sector. It uses causal principles to create phase lightnings with extremely low flux generation. In simple words, it is the ""flux vent"" for the causal shock emitter, it just needs to generate some flux to direct the energy generated when causal shock emitter disrupts the phase space structure, and then it can simply release these energy without generating any flux. The energy released would generate phase lightnings, and that's why it's called causal lightning emitter.",,,,

But it requires more logistic communication bandwidth to command, and so comparing to agolo, its squadron size is greatly reduced.",,,,
dpl_marimba_I,SHIP,"The design of Marimba started not far before the Collapse, similar to when Cobra was designed. The phase lab used their access to view the rejected proposal of Cobra, and they were enlightened. They realized that the idea of anti-capital torpedo bombers could be further developped, leading to a general class of bomber that could carry phase lab experimental weapons.

This bomber would be a good general purpose experimental platform in hands of the Phase Lab, and its weapons could also be modified to serve many different roles in the domain navy. Then the Collapse happened, and the phase lab had to postpone this design until they settled down in the sector. 

Nonetheless, the phase lab still gives the grammophone torpedo system to this bomber, and put it on market, to compete with trident, and it turns out to be a success afterall.",,,,
dpl_marimba_II,SHIP,"Marimba Mk.II was an alternative design based on the design of Marimba. The phase lab created this design based on the reviews about Marimba they received from market. The buyers' opinions reflected that it would be nice if the damage of the Grammophone torpedo could be further improved.

And so as the answer, the Phase Lab installed Phonograph torpedo system on the bomber. Though such idea looks crazy, the Marimba Mk.II bomber actually turns out to be popular on the market. And so the phase lab continues to produce this fighter, making it a mature product.",,,,
dpl_choir,SHIP,"Choir is an anti-capital fighter design made by the Phase Lab in the recent decade. The Phase Lab designed this fighter to make it possible for mass productions in local factories of the sector.

The fleet log also suggests that Tri-Tachyon did send several test pilots to fly this ship, but all of them quitted pretty quickly for various reasons. And then this ship was sent to a Tri-Tachyon prototype lab that is unknown to the Persean Sector at large, as a research material. This ship has a very special and unique device that could induce and control some 'motes'. But it's best to turn this device off when not in battle, or it will burn out the reactor rods quite quickly.",,,,

Though these low-frequency anomalies are not energetic enough to generate shield-piercing arcs, and they need an additional expandable stablizer to survive, they are reproducible. This is the main reason why they raise interests among Phase Lab researchers.

Nowadays, this ship was almost forgotten, since Hydraulis, a more suitable experimental platform, was designed and produced. But in the hands of smart captains, it could still be an extraordinary combat ship.",,,,
