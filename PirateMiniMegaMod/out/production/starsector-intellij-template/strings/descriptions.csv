hook,SHIP,"The Hook is a heavily modified iteration of the classic Talon design, boasting an improvised omni shield generator controlled by a copilot to counter light PD retaliations. It can deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses.",,,
blaster_drone,SHIP,"This mining auxiliary has been repurposed into an unmanned bomber. The retrofits include a compacted mining blaster and a jury rigged sensor module to allow limited independent functionality. These modifications entirely disregard the limited energy grid of the original design, resulting in a full system meltdown upon firing its payload.",,,

shrike_omega,SHIP,"Folks at Disaster Rec received an unusual report following the inspection of Operation Manager Quinn Huang's last reported location. Scans show an eccentric vessel emerging from a disabled [REDACTED] - [See Anomalous Hulls Board Report 5/13 section 17.C]. Posthumous recovery of eyewitnesses Tri-I ocular datastores indicate the vessels ability to teleport despite readings unlike that of a phase skim capable craft. As of now, review board agents attribute the readings of the vessel (dubbed ""Aeon"") as akin to a temporal time manipulation field revealing a terrifying possibility.",Unidentified Vessel,"UNKNOWN ENTRY

kite_P,SHIP,"A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This shuttle has been heavily moddified by pirates to install a  an expanded missile rack paired with an advanced autoloader, enabling an impressive missile onslaught despite its compact size. These upgrades came at a cost: the shield generator was removed, leaving the ship unprotected, and power has been diverted from the aux propulsion subsystem.",,,
nebula2,SHIP,"The Nebula-class Civilian Transport is a prime target of pirate attacks. A few are later found at the broken heart of a sharp spray of impact debris in some lonely orbit. Others earn a pirate's second appraising glance and are hauled off to secret shipyards. Crew Quarters are ripped apart, replaced with trusses to hold weapons mounts and souped-up ammo feed lines.

This Nebula, reborn in vacuum and fire, now delivers a cargo of death from the hand of a pirate warlord.",,,
champion2,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser, a versatile mainstay in League fleets, rarely finds its way into pirate hands, and even less frequently undergoes a transformation of this magnitude. At the focus of this transformation involves the ""Crowning"" energy subsystems, positioned just beneath a formidable heavy energy battery. This convenient design allows for the seamless rerouting of flux into the energy grid and the installation of a devastating emitter. The result is a hull that can unleash devastating energy arcs, earning it the moniker ""Flux Core."" However, this newfound power comes at a cost. Subsystem reliability takes a hit, and the risk of critical core failures increases.",,,
colossus32,SHIP,"The Colossus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. A similarly haphazard process sees most cargo decks collapsed and re-welded to form thick armor dotted with numerous weapons emplacements. The primary cargo bay was left open, however, and converted into an ersatz fighter launch bay with the addition of a micro civilian forge-vat intended for the manufacture of machine parts hacked to accept fighter LPC chips. The forge is poorly integrated with the hull's base power system, resulting in unreliable overall performance.

The Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,
prometheus3,SHIP,"The Prometheus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. A similarly haphazard process sees most fuel tanks collapsed and re-welded to form thick armor dotted with numerous weapons emplacements. The primary tank has been split open and converted into a vast ersatz fighter launch bay with the addition of a micro civilian forge-vat intended for the manufacture of machine parts hacked to accept fighter LPC chips.
