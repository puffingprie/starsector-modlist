Reduces the combat readiness cost per deployment and recovery rate by %s.

The per-day supply consumption for CR recovery is reduced to account for the slower recovery rate, but increasing the maximum number of deployments a ship can undertake before recovery will also increase the maximum cost of recovery proportionally. The total supply cost per deployment remains the same. 

Also reduces most secondary CR costs by %s, for no net change in supply costs.",Improves deployment logistics.,,graphics/prv/hullmods/prv_ruggedization.png
