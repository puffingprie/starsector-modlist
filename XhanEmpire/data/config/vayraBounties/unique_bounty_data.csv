Who do you serve? The obsolete vestiges of the old Domain? Are you a slave to the material? Or perhaps, you are a slave to fear. You fear mankinds accomplishments, and our future...”

Zekor stands up and paces, tracked by his view screen. Facing away, he stands contrapposto; exaggerating his lithe, bio-technologically enhanced body. Twisting around in a rehearsed; almost theatrical manner, he once again faces the view screen.

“Why do you not submit? I have snuffed out countless slaves like you, all willing to throw away not just their own lives, but all of mans future. Submit to the Divine Emperor, this is the only chance we will ever have. We have to run towards progress. Run fast enough so that when we finally jump, we will take flight and never come down. If we do not, then all mankind will fall, forever.”

Crossing his arms, he looks down towards an open hand. Staring at his fingers as he slowly curls them, seemingly impressed by his own synthetic body. After a moment his eyes dart up towards the screen and he takes on a morose expression; as if he had just been roused from a pleasant daydream.
