After settling off a docket with the admiral for a 'go-ahead' to Naraka, the ticket there felt like a sweet ride with the rest of the boys from Lubrin after a few raids. All the guns and bullets to be had right and there. All that blasting about with my high caliber autoguns, and Grace, she's a beauty. Like a really nice bike, all cylinders and no slag.

To think, the big break was right around the corner, lots of wrecked scrap for the taking. And that, there was.

A huge Hegemony fleet just went by. Passed, as we sneak around the star cloud in Tia. The whole shabang: Conquests, Dominators, goddamn Moras and them silly Gryphons with their dumb sockpuppets sticking out. But none of them got nothing to the Onslaught I got to see with my own eyes. Painted in orange, like the star sitting besides us. The real prize.

So the boys and I got to it and ask the meister if we could take it headon. And, by God, we really got a headon for it. We strapped in with Grace and brought Sonny with us, with all the guns the two could possibly hold and went straight out there. 

And right there. We got ourselves a big boy to fight.
