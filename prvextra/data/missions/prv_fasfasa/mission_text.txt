The raid had been easy - the marines were in and out in less than an hour, blatantly smug about getting the AI core they were sent for - and there wasn't a single Tritach patrol to be seen. Until now. 

The fringe Jump-point ahead is blocked by a lone frigate, broadcasting its corporate ID far and wide. It is most certainly not as lonesome as it appears. It figures - the best point to intercept a phase fleet is at a jump point. Trying to outsmart the AI corp was never really expected to work. Still, the Tritachs are much too busy fighting the Hegemony - there can't be that many ships here. We just need to break though their lines.
