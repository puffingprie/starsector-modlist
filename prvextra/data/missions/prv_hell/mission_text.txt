Location: The particle swirls of Ryak
Date: 171.03.27

Your convoy was just transiting through the upper atmosphere of the gas giant Ryak, heading towards the High-Energy Labs when a group of heavy warships that were most certainly not a local patrol emerged from the impervious mists of the giant planet, burning hard on an interception vector towards your convoy.

It's the god damned Rusters! Pirate rats, terrorists, bandits, robbers, criminals of the worst kind!

Signaling your distress at the station, you can only hope that they can send a relief patrol before it's too late.
