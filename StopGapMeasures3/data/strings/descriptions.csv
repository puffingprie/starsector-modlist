# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
filgap_asp,SHIP,"This custom-built bomber uses only low-tech parts. Unlike most other bomber designs, the Asp boasts a good speed to compensate the short range of the David missile it carries. Not able to make any difference in large battles, but cheap and good in pursuit and against small ships.",,,
filgap_ethon,SHIP,"This midline interceptor is a failed design brought back to life by the desperate times of the Sector. It sports a single Locust Salvo and a boosted PD Laser designed to engage small craft. The hull itself has good capabilities, but lacks firepower and is unable to shoot down enemy ordnance.",,,
filgap_filum,SHIP,"This drone has been used to limited extent to help construct remote stations in deep space. A bit more elegant than the ordinary mining drones, the Filum use its Wielding Beam to help manipulate material in space. It helps its parent ship not only to build, but also salvage all kind of space-born objects. The beam itself is an adequate PD weapon, while the graviton flux may occasionnally disable incoming enemy craft
",,,
filgap_maringuin,SHIP,"The always resourceful pirates developped this corvette to provide more firepower against heavily shielded prey. The concept is quite rudimentary -a loading shuttle which utility pods has been replaced by crude missile launchers- but is an easily replicable one",,,
filgap_bentu,SHIP,"A combat high tech drone able to operate in group. This fighter is only recently deploying alongside Tri-Tachyon fleets, with its parent ship, the Formica. While its link to the Terminator drone is quite evident in the design, some observators have noticed strong similarities with some autonomous designs observed in dangerous place of the Persean Sector. COMSEC is still trying to get some specimen to investigate these rumors.",,,


filgap_velite,SHIP,"
The Velite relies solely on ballistic and energy mounts, with sufficient power supply to keep a steady rate of fire. Unlike other mid-tech ships of its size, the Velite fits in no particular defensive or offensive role. While the ship sports no fancy systems or higher-than-average specificities like speed or armor, it is easily mass-produced and is able to field various weapon loadouts for increased adaptability.

When the Persean League was formed, the unification of the many various defense fleets was expected to be difficult. Indeed, industrial capabilities, weaponry and manpower varied greatly from one world to another. As Hegemony, and later Tri-Tachyon dreams of expansion were approaching, the Persean League was looking for a way to field a uniform fleet composition across its territory. The Velite is one of the results of the development programs of the time.",,,
filgap_huntsman,SHIP,"The Huntsman is an old design dating from the early era of the Sector. At the time, it was designed with a support role in mind. Bearing several composite mounts, the Huntsman could be assigned many different roles like missile boat, gunship, or escort. However, weak armor and poor generator performance means that the ship is not well suited to front-line duties. Instead, it uses a series of auxiliary jets to flee from overpowering foes and redeploy during battle.",,,

filgap_merx,SHIP,"Since Tri-Tachyon has some of the most valuable and rare assets in the sector, the Corporation cannot afford losing them in small skirmishes and looked for an alternative. The Merx is a small conversion of the Mercury acting as a cheap rank-and-file corvette. It mounts a supplementary slot for missile weaponry occupying most of the passenger space. Easily produced, its crew is expected to make sure to protect irrepleceable ships, going as far as to sacrifice itself in the process...",,,

filgap_fulk,SHIP,"Faced with the need to increase its defensive capabilities, the Luddic Church decided to introduce a new frigate type designed for convoy defense and patrol duties. The Hound was selected for its high armor and maneuverability. However, the Fulk no longer looks much like its parent, as its hull has been significantly enlarged. Crewed by new aspirants, the Fulk provides protection to other ships thanks to lateral flare launchers and several point defence mounts. The ship is not able to beat enemy frigates in a one-on-one scenario, and is expected to sacrifice itself in order to protect the more valuable assets of the Luddic Church fleet.

At the heart of Luddic Church dogma lies the rejection of relying on machines to do human deeds. In effect, most advanced ship designs are simply rejected for production and banished from Church territory. This policy comes at a price however, as the Knights are expected to fight technological abominations with old ships often unable to match their foes. Following border conflicts with Tibicena station, the Knights of Ludd decreed that new ships must be developed to drive back any threat from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ship models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_dove,SHIP,"The Dove is a lightly armed ship used as a scout and sentinel for larger fleets.

Following a successful infiltration into the root software of the Comm Relay system by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Hegemony government ordered the destruction of all existing relays until a replacement network was built. Factions had to rely on couriers and messengers to carry orders and news. The Dove was one of the ship classes designed to fill this role. When the FTL relay net was rebuilt, the Dove was decommissioned and later converted to fit a scouting role. With limited ordnance, the Dove relies on speed to flee from enemy threats. The ship now integrates a sensor package and is used as a scout for Hegemony detachments.",,,
filgap_chondrite,SHIP,"The Chondrite is a light freighter once built to conduct fast interplanetary transport of perishable but valuable goods. Once praised for its sub-luminal delivery speed, it is now praised for how quickly it can get out of trouble once it inevitably finds itself in a combat environment.",,,
filgap_traverse,SHIP,"Before the Cerberus and the Hound were considered freighters of choice in the dangerous space of the Sector, the Traverse was a more common design which gained its popularity thanks to a higher cargo capacity than ships of similar size.",,,
filgap_pyrphoros,SHIP,"The Pyrphoros is a desperate attempt to convert the most common tanker in the sector - the Dram - into a combat vessel. The hull has received structural reinforcement and now also boasts several gun mounts as well as missile racks. The ship is still poorly armored, feels under-gunned, and moves like a brick. This converted design is only fielded by pirates when no other ship is available. ",,,
filgap_rosatom,SHIP,"The Rosatom is originally a auxilliary support ship, revolving around its large capacitor banks. The Persean Sector has forced its induction to a more frontline duty. Even with its no-thrill characteristics, its generator and its various mount, this frigate is able to fill many role in fleets and is commonly used as an light combat complement.",,,
,,,,,
filgap_dragoon,SHIP,"The Dragoon is a destroyer with a strange layout based on the Cossack. It is designed in a much more agressive way, including frontal weapons and an experimental EMP system.

This destroyer was probably designed as an offshoot of the Cossack, or both ships are just very radical versions of the same structure. Both ships were envisioned as escort destroyers, and the Dragoon was expected to follow larger combat units and protect them against the emergence of small attack craft and missiles swarms. Production capability for this ship has now been long lost and the ship is only seen derelict in remote ruined systems or in scavenger fleets lucky enough to salvage it in proper condition.",,,
filgap_cossack,SHIP,"This ship is an escort carrier designed at the same time as the Legion. Designed as a polyvalent platform, the Cossack is able to lead patrols and provide efficient support to the rest of the fleet.

At the time it was designed, the Cossack was only a minor success, trying to accomplish too many tasks and being a master of none. It cannot fill front lines nor act as a true dedicated carrier. However, it is appreciated by today's Hegemony naval planners because of its simple production and its ability to be a temporary solution to missing roles in any fleet.

Some patterns in the flux system of the ship, its divided structure and the peculiar fitting of the missile systems argue that the Cossack is part of a larger design able fill many roles. The ship structures seem to be a platform on which other modules can be installed to radically change the loadout.",,,
,,,,,

filgap_templar,SHIP,"Based on the widespread and well known design of the Enforcer, the Templar is built to serve as a missile destroyer in fleet engagements. It is expected to unload its two medium missile mounts at the right time during battle, while still providing support with its ballistic mount. This design replaces two ballistic medium mounts by smaller ones and sacrifices the burn drive to mount a faster reloading system for missile mounts. 

At the heart of Luddic Church dogma lies the rejection of relying on machines to do human deeds. In effect, most advanced ship designs are simply rejected for production and banished from Church territory. This policy comes at a price however, as the Knights are expected to fight technological abominations with old ships often unable to match their foes. Following border conflicts with Tibicena station, the Knights of Ludd decreed that new ships must be developed to drive back any threat from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ship models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_auspicious,SHIP,"The Auspicious is a retro-fit of the Apogee. The cruiser has been re-purposed into a front-line ship or to serve in a command role by independent factions unable to produce true dedicated warships. Its exploration systems and its large storage have been removed and replaced by large bays. The main weaponry is based on salvaged TPC's which can make use of the efficient flux systems. Since Apogee cruisers are valuable exploration vessels, only the most desperate or minor independent planets are willing to convert those venerable hulls. Most often, the Auspicious are re-built derelicts or ships whose owners were unable to maintain properly.",,,

filgap_bogomil,SHIP,"The Bogomil is a fire support destroyer based on the Tarsus freighter. Most of the space in the freighter was used to implement an ammo feeder system provisioning the heavy ballistic mount. The ship enjoys the hull strength of the Tarsus, but also its poor flux capacity, even with the improvements to the original generator. This destroyer is thus best used along other ships in a fleet battle. The Luddic Church chose to produce this ship as the Tarsus parts are easily produced by the low-tech facilities on Ceyx, which doesn't impair Condor conversion.

In the heart of Luddic Church dogma lies the rejection of relying on machines to do human deeds. In effect, most advanced ships designs are simply rejected for production and banished from Church territory.

These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ships models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_pyrrhocorax,SHIP,"This light carrier is a support ship, both in combat and logistically. With few weapons and only one wing complement, it cannot lead the fight in the front-line. However, adaptable loadouts and a large fuel and cargo storage capacity makes it a valuable addition to any small raiding party.

An original design of Tri-Tachyon, the Pyrrhocorax was birthed following the First AI War when attack fleets had to rely on Gemini and other low combat-value ships for logistical support. Using spare parts and easily produced components, the ship was designed to provide support to high-tech frigates, including protection against enemy carriers, electronic warfare and long-range firepower.",,,
filgap_herder,SHIP,"When the Drover-class carrier was put into production, many officers complained about the outward appearance of the ship and nicknamed it the 'brick'. As a consequence, Orion Shipyards designed a new ship with identical parts and characteristics as the Drover. The Herder fills the exact same role as the Drover, its just prettier than its predecessor. The replacement program was still active when the gates shut down, meaning both classes are commonly encountered within the Sector.
Take it with a pinch of salt.",,,
filgap_copernic,SHIP,"
The Copernic is a specialized science vessel sporting two adaptable modules to give it some flexibility in its duties. Its primary benefits are an upgraded space hazard shielding to protect its delicate sensor equipment and the necessary modular space to fit two more logistics modifications as per the requirements of its mission. It is commonly employed in exploration, but can also serve as a specialized electronic warfare ship for factions able to maintain such technology. While capable of defending itself, the Copernic lacks the punch to be able to fit a combat role in more than a support role.",,,
filgap_ballista,SHIP,"The Ballista is a destroyer focusing heavily on missile weaponry. While not able to defend itself properly, it can support combat lines by unleashing volleys of missiles adapted to every situation. 

This ship is undoubtedly of pirate origin. A close look quickly allows one to recognize parts of civilian ships which cannot be repurposed in better designs. Large internal space is occupied by stocks of ordnance to support its large missile payload. The design is commonly shunned by factions with proper ship building capabilities due to its heavy supply burden and it often sees use in defense fleets where missile inventories can be easily replenished.",,,
filgap_tantive,SHIP,"The Tantive combat freighter started its life as an atmospheric combat gunship for special forces and other elite troops. However, the idea occured to Tri-Tachyon engineers to convert old maneuvering jets to new plasma jets. The Tantive is now used as a blockade runner, with a forward facing armament and shield designed to pierce enemy lines then flee using its increased thruster capabilities.",,,
filgap_orthus,SHIP,"The Orthus is an early high-tech ship designed at the same time as the Odyssey to act as a ship-of-the-line in frontal assaults. The ship boasts a strong shield backed up by a fortress system. Sporting several forward-facing energy mounts and a complement of missile systems, the Orthus is able to anchor any line of battle.

This destroyer was rapidly phased out by more maneuverable designs and the appearance of phase skimmer technology. It is a rather uncommon ship at odds with most faction's warfare philosophy, but can still be found in Tri-Tachyon patrol fleets.",,,

filgap_wardlaw,SHIP,"
This combat-oriented conversion of the Tarsus freighter into a destroyer, or more precisely a Q-Ship, is used to give some protection to merchant fleets against lesser threats. This ship is designed as well as a poor-man's destroyer can be, yet it is capable of can springing a nasty surprise on unsuspecting pirates and privateers alike. The Wardlaw keeps the original shape of a Tarsus and can easily be mistaken for one on long range sensors, but when engaged in combat up close, it reveals itself to be the predator rather than the prey. Or at the very least more dangerous prey.

Many turrets have been added to the general frame, as well as a better shield generator so that this combat freighter can hold its own against true raider frigates. Heavy armor plating has also been added to improve protection, but also to conceal the other modifications. Finally, improved thrusters allow it to still reach a decent speed. However, much of the original cargo space has been filled with combat equipment, so the Wardlaw is no longer able to ferry large cargo loads.",,,

filgap_nitassinan,SHIP,"The Nistassinan was born shortly after the Collapse by converting a system-bound tug and utility ship into a combat destroyer. A robust ship used by independant shipyards, it boasts an interesting mix of firepower and heavy armor. Lack of fancy systems or powerful drives mean it’s mostly deployed when no true military-grade destroyers are available. This design is vulnerable to flanking.",,,



filgap_chrysops,SHIP,"At the apex of the firepower doctrine sponsored by the Domain, an RnD project was tasked to develop a new hull integrating recent discovery in phase field area. The destroyer relies on sneaking and frontal firepower over armor. With plating comparable to a frigate one, the Chrysops uses instead a time dilatation field to protect it. 

The project was deemed too costly and never saw large scale production. It can still be found as blueprints in remote stations, but is not currently in use in the Sector.",,,


,,,,,
filgap_opportunity,SHIP,"Originally developed by a Kazeron deserter and later Pirate Warlord, the Opportunity is a mash-up of civilian ship components added to the base platform of the Venture to transform it into a true warship. The original ships' trade cargo space and mining drone bays were replaced with heavy plating, reinforced bulkheads and a better power generator. Additionally, a Damper field was also installed, as well as supplemental weapon mounts.

The Opportunity includes components from common trade ships which haven't already been re-purposed by pirate fleets. While simple in its design and easily reproducible, the conversion job still needs proper facilities meaning only the richer pirate warlords can own an Opportunity-class cruiser.",,,
filgap_adjudicator,SHIP,"The Adjudicator-class armored cruiser fills the role of convoy leader or fleet escort. Its weapon mounts have broad firing arcs to counter more maneuverable ships. A centralized armory in the heart of the ship allows it to unleash impressive firepower at the right moment. However, its generator is not able to sustain advanced weaponry nor to withstand heavy fire. Thus the ship is aimed at hunting enemy destroyers and is not expected to enter full-scale battle against larger enemy vessels.

During the AI Wars, the Hegemony’s resources were stretched to their limits. The industrial power of the Aztlan and Corvus systems was unable to produce sufficient ship hulls to keep up with attrition rates. Moreover, frequent raids on mercantile convoys by Tri-Tachyon forces threatened to bring hull production to a standstill. Hegemony R&D proposed to solve both problems -intensive raiding and a lacks of ships - by commissioning a new cruiser to escort heavy cruisers and convoys against fast enemy ships. In cooperation with the naval scrapyard of Nomios, they designed a ship based on easy to produce and salvageable parts of ships of the line. The resulting Adjudicator is an elegant mash-up of Onslaught, Falcon and Dominator ship parts. In quieter periods, the ship was decommissioned en-masse and sold to neutral worlds. The hull is still produced as a part of a trade pact with the Luddic Church due to its contribution during the AI Wars..",,,
filgap_foundation,SHIP,"The Foundation originate from the same drawing boards than the Apogee, and share many similar feature with it. However, it was designed to work in less hazardous region of deep space, which is reflected by it's lower grade of weaponery and shielding. Nonetheless, it's salvaging abilities and drone coverage are well appreciated by salvage companies.",,,
filgap_formica,SHIP,"This drone tender is a recent addition in Tri-Tachyon fleets, reasing numerous questions about the corporation real manufacturing capabilities and it's willingness to comply to AI enforcement regulations. The ship has been observed providing close craft support to other high tech ships thanks to this cutting-edges drones. The ship itself, while not has ground-breaking as the Aurora, is still able to deploy an extensive array of weapons adapted to frontal assault.",,,
filgap_wagner,SHIP,"This cruiser sized vessel dates from the early epoch of energy weaponry. Its primary role is to anchor the battle line, providing frontal firepower while exposing only a small silhouette. The Wagner comprises a wide array of different weaponry, making it a great ship for inventive captains wanting to try different loadouts. It is still considered outclassed in regard to other line cruisers commonly used in the Sector and is vulnerable to flanking fire.",,,
filgap_cathar,SHIP,"The Cathar is a more sensible attempt at converting the Colossus into a true cruiser. The huge cargo hold now shelters a more efficient generator, while the hull is upgraded with more armor as well as a bristling array of weapons. The ship performs well in frontal assaults and is also designed to cover other ships of the Luddic fleet. The conversion work of a ship this size is however only possible in large shipyards. This means that the Luddic Church produces Cathar hulls at a slow rate and deploys them only when necessary.",,,
filgap_starblazer,SHIP,"This makeshift carrier uses the hull of the Starliner to provide fleet-wide protection to any civilian convoy. Its large bays allow a respectable complement of wings but its makeshift decks struggle to quickly replace losses during long engagements. The ship has some active defenses of its own thanks to numerous small mounts and the original shield mounted on the Starliner. However, its armor is paper-thin and the Starblazer remains easy prey when caught without its fighter complement. 

This conversion is a rare occurrence in the Sector. The process to convert the Starliner is long and fastidious, but doesn't need a huge amount of resources. Non-aligned worlds, scavengers, pirates and other groups without access to production facilities or military-grade carriers are the most likely to use the Starblazer.",,,
filgap_contemptor,SHIP,"The Contemptor is a strange design in regard to its age. It boasts an integrated TPC and heavy armor like the Onslaught, mounting substantial forward firepower typical of the early period of the Domain. However, the ship seems to be a conversion of something older. Life support systems, cramped crew compartments and the shield generator appear to have been installed around other components where space was left. Moreover, the ship shows a strong level of automation, reducing the need for crew. Some scavengers say that aggressive, brainless ships similar to the Contemptor are hunting remote places never visited by human beings.",,,

filgap_redoubt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A rare sight defending Domain probes, this ship is built around a TPC. The Redoubt is not to be underestimated, as it boasts significant frontal firepower and heavy armor.",,,
filgap_carcajou,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Caracajou share a very similar appearance to the Scarab, as well as its deadly potential. The time manipulation system doesn't seem to interfere with the hive-like AI decision network of the Remnants, a fact that deeply concern the Hegemony and Tri-Tachyon alike.",,,

filgap_era,SHIP,"A highly customisable ship designed for frontier duty, the Era is a cruiser-sized ship originally assigned to orbital construction sites and mining fleets. It provides limited production capabilities and respectable cargo and fuel capacities. As the ship was supposed to remain mostly in real space and not expected to make long journeys in hyperspace, its burn speed is limited.

In the current age of the Sector, the Era is used as combat freighter, reserve cruiser and exploration vessel. Its combat capabilities are limited, but its integrated factory is able to extend the duration in which it can provide missile support.",,,

filgap_era_lc,SHIP,"Another custom conversion produced by the Church of Galactic Redemption, this version of the Era is providing a small complement of fighters to Luddic fleet, at the cost of customization and missile capacity.

The ship was initially the product of an unlikely cooperation between sects of the Path and sects of Beholder station. The two factions shared production capacity and knowledge (respectively) to assemble "reclamation" fleets aimied at finding new marvels of the Creation, but also tracking and hunting down soulless abominations left behind by the Domain. 

In the current age of the Sector, the Era is used as combat freighter, reserve cruiser and exploration vessel. Its combat capabilities are limited, but its integrated factory is able to extend the duration in which it can provide missile support.",,,

filgap_babel,SHIP,"While most Mora-class carriers have been put in service again, some of the converted designs can still be seen within the Sector. The Babel is one of them, serving as a mobile dry dock used in salvage operations. Its reduced carrier capabilities allow it to serve as a support vessel, complemented by its original missile complement.",,,
filgap_pharos,SHIP,"Exploration and colonization of every new Sector was made possible thanks to Domain probes but also specialized civilian ships. The Pharos is one of them, half-way between a waystation and tanker. It boast a similar logistical profile than the Phaeton but at the scale of a cruiser. Weapons mounts allow a very good point-defense coverage but it's still a civilian vessel. As a mobile waystation, the Pharos can still help its escort to navigate more easily at the tactical scale.",,,

filgap_trajan,SHIP,"The design philosophy behind the Trajan-class battlecarrier is quite simply: if you can't kill it with big guns, try with big ordnance. With the big guns usually supplied by the Conquest, this Battlecarrier fills other roles from combined assault to ranged support to fleet coverage. Fielding a full extent of missile systems, as well as a fast reloading mechanism, the Trajan can open the way for its fighter/bomber complement by sending wave after wave of missiles. Several energy and ballistic mounts allow it to directly engage multiple targets, as long as they aren't other capital ships. A rarer design than the Conquest, the Trajan is mostly fielded by the Persean League, as this kind of ship is shunned by the Hegemony and Tri-Tachyon prefers the Astral fleet carrier.",,,

filgap_charon,SHIP,"This small capital ship was deployed en-masse by the Domain to put down any independent will from frontier world. The external armor plating is designed for atmospheric entry and the hull can house a small invading force on its own. Once on the ground the ... will act as a forward supply and firepower base. Its powerfull engines allow escape from gravity well.

This ship is now a rare sight, as the armor plates are hard to maintain and produce, and the hull is too big to be built by most shipyards. Still, the ship is appreciated by aggressive factions for large scale invasions, or for colonization attempts, as it can still pack a punch against patrol or pirate fleets.",,,

filgap_kuunlan,SHIP,"Big mining conglomerates needed large ship for long exploitation and surveying missions in remote expanses while the Sector was still in its colonization stage. These ships, nearly miniature space stations, had to be able to travel to new sites, while being able to carry back ore and volatiles but also protect them from local pirates and scavengers. Combined with smaller brethen like the Venture and the Shepherd, they made large convoys plundering asteroid belts and gas clouds, bringing back needed resources to the core worlds every years to feed the forever-hungry colonization process.

The Kunnlan is a vestige of this past. Built like a brick, it sports multiple various mounts to be able to both mine asteroid and blast pirates. Several bays allow to support mining operations or project power across the battlefield. While not particularly strong-hitting, it's a tough nute to break, and a great logistical ship for those able to afford it. At the time of the Collapse, this ship was largely decommissioned and only a few examples of this beast were still available. At the current time, this class of ship is often disregarded for its lack of power but also its logistical profile, but large mercenary companies and other less-official parties still use some to extract secrets and bounties from the forgotten places of the Sector.",,,

filgap_bahamut,SHIP,"The Bahamut is an armored freighter, but at the scale of a battlecruiser. With large cargo holds, good weapon coverage and low-duration emergency burn-drive, it was definitely designed to deliver its cargo in a combat environment. It is largely able to create its own opening in a blockade thanks to its substential frontal firepower and figter supports. 

For all these qualities, little is known about this ship and its provenance. It's suspected to be one of the many designs that fell out of use after the emergence of the Atlas-Gate combinaison, and was forgotten sinces hundreds of cycles in some lost blueprint. And yet, now this ship emerges once more, only to be used as a prized raider flagship by pirate warlord and opportunistic salvage fleets. It seems one member of the Kanta dynasty came accross the Bahamut schematics a few decades ago and realized its potential as a jack-of-all-trade capital to complemente the glass cannon that is the Atlas MKII.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,
,,,,,
filgap_magaccelerator,WEAPON,The Mag Accelerator is the ancestor of the modern Railgun. This early tentative attempt to create precise and reliable magnetic weapons is still used in the fleets of many factions. The gun propels shells with a shaped charge which was developed before shields appeared as a common feature on warships. Now the Mag Accelerator lacks the punch for contemporary conflicts with a too-heavy power requirement. It is mostly found on patrol ships or during anti-pirate actions.,Close Support,,
filgap_scattergun,WEAPON,The Scattergun is a mid-range PDS. The gun is notoriously inaccurate but fires a salvo of 6 slugs which perform well against missile salvos. The system is not able to track lateral threats efficiently and is best used on frontal mounts.,PDS,,
filgap_plasma_caster,WEAPON,"During the AI Wars, Tri-Tachyon raiding parties were in need of a weapon able to put constant pressure on enemies while striking elements were maneuvering. Scientists and engineers created a reduced-scale plasma cannon to fire over-heated projectiles over larger distance than classical laser weaponry. However, due to heat problems in the small weapon, it shoots 3 small projectiles in salvo with unusual inaccuracy for an energy weapon.",Assault,,
filgap_david,WEAPON,"A basic warhead with a shaped charge built by factions in need of anti-armor missiles and unable to get proper military-grade weaponry. The missile has better speed than the Harpoon thanks to a smaller warhead, but is inefficient against anything bigger than a destroyer.",Strike,,
filgap_davidsystem,WEAPON,"
An improved launcher designed to fire a short volley of anti-ship SRMs. Easy to replicate, this launcher is commonly used by pirates and independent worlds unable to get their hands on Reaper torpedoes or Harpoon pods.

filgap_stpc,WEAPON,"A moderately successful attempt to salvage the Thermal Pulse Cannon from Onslaught wrecks. It boast similar characteristics to the original weapons to the exception of accuracy and range. So far only the Apogee-class cruiser has the structure and power linkages to be able to support this weapon.",Assault,,
filgap_ion_torpedo,WEAPON,"The Lotop is a pre-Collapse, long-range, multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagements upon targets of opportunity. The MIRV system splits into 6 warheads containing a plasma charge, generating an ionizing effect on impact. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount in reserve compared to more typical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,
filgap_chargedlaser,WEAPON,"The Charged Laser is considered an older version, or a precursor of, the Pulse Laser. It accumulates energy through a series of capacitors which is released and focused along a twin array in short bursts. The aging design allows a longer range but generates a massive amount of flux, relegating the weapon to auxiliary ships and pirates able to salvage it from old weapon caches.",Assault,,
filgap_icebomb,WEAPON,"An old weapon from another age, the energy bomb launcher was designed at the apex of shield technology. The ball of energy released produces a massive wave able to interfere with the shields of ships in a large area. However, it generates a massive amount of flux and takes a long time to reload, making this weapon available only to the largest ships and space stations. Since the Collapse, the Ice Bomb has been lost and is now just a mere legend from a long past age. However, some veteran spacers claim that in some dark places of the Sector, terrible inhuman things have been seen using such weapons with dreaded effect",Support,,
filgap_ion_torpedo_single,WEAPON,"A launcher containing a single Lotop cruise missile. Mostly assigned to support frigates and as weapons of opportunity for larger ships.

The Lotop is a pre-Collapse, long-range, multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagements upon targets of opportunity. The MIRV system splits into 6 warheads containing a plasma charge, generating an ionizing effect on impact. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount in reserve compared to more typical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,

filgap_matsar,WEAPON,"The Matsar is the zenith of the Lotop technology. A fully-fledged combat system including a fire control mechanism able to guide two missiles at a time, it also includes a somewhat slow but reliable combat-rated autoloader, ensuring persistent combat performance.

The Lotop is a pre-Collapse, long-range, multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagements upon targets of opportunity. The MIRV system splits into 6 warheads containing a plasma charge, generating an ionizing effect on impact. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount in reserve compared to more typical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,

filgap_psurge,WEAPON,"A byproduct of the Plasma Cannon, the Plasma Surge is an antique PDS system designed to stop waves of missiles. It projects a ball of plasma which turns unstable when encountering matter, provoking a rapid expansion of super-heated energy. The unstable nature of the projectile means it’s somewhat short-ranged and struggles to pierce armor.  The weapon has a slow rate of fire due to heating problems, but its area-of-effect makes it a useful PDS to cover the ship from missiles swarms.",PDS,,
filgap_miningbeam,WEAPON,"A simple mid-range mining-grade burst beam. Quite efficient but flux-hungry. The huge mass of the weapon makes it unwieldy, but it's still appreciated when no other energy weapon is available.",Support,,
filgap_miningarray,WEAPON,"Following the Collapse, mining guilds have been a prime provider of makeshift weapons, repurposed ships and last-chance odd jobs. The MB-3 Array is such an example, an acceptable attempt to build a heavier PDS for civilian ships. Three mining projectors are mounted together, firing overloaded streams. It allows better range and damage output than classical mining beams. However, the array is power-hungry and the more diffuse beam greatly reduces effectiveness against anything armoured or shielded.",PDS,,
filgap_hive,WEAPON,"A larger mount of the ubiquitous Swarmer. It includes an automated reloading system but fires smaller salvos at a slower rate than its smaller cousin.",PDS,,
filgap_saturation_launcher,WEAPON,"A poor-man's semi-guided missile only used by the desperate and planets unable to manufacture shaped charges. The launcher fires an impressive salvo, useful to finish crippled ships and divert fire from PDS. Useless against fighters.",Close Support,,
filgap_mosychlosbag,WEAPON,"This medium ballistic system is a crude mash-up of two smaller assault guns. The barrels have been extended to significantly increase range. The ammo used is underwhelming for the size of the gun, and accuracy is quickly lost at longer ranges. Vibration caused by recoil means the gun must fire in salvos instead of continuously. The design is still quite able to put down smaller ships and even threaten swarms of fighters.",Assault,,
filgap_aton,WEAPON,"The larger cousin of the Charged Laser is able to produce a constant stream for a short amount of time thanks to multiple heavy-duty capacitors. Capable of a large energy burst over a short amount of time. Great for general purpose applications but with lower range than the heaviest beam available.",General,,
filgap_scorpius,WEAPON,"A variant of the Pilum missile system. The original explosive warhead is removed and replaced by a hyper-dense material tip and improved thruster. The resulting system allows a ship to fire a volley of missiles at long range that are efficient against shield systems. The ease of production of the missile allows in-combat fabrication and a reliable autoloader conveys replacement ordnance to the launcher throughout an engagement",Support,,

nora_station1,CUSTOM,"Initially designed to extract water to supply nearby Nepheria, this station has since been salvaged of any useful components.",,"The station has lain dormant for tens of cycles. Most systems, including life support, have been transferred to Nepheria, leaving the station a cold skeleton floating in space.",
planet_nepheria,CUSTOM,"This second-rank industrial planet would have been annexed long ago by the major factions without such a fiercely independent-minded population. The planet is well defended, and each of the major factions are ready to intervene if any other makes a gesture to invade. Due to its particular position, Nepheria acts as a diplomatic and trading no man's land.",,,
planet_scilly,CUSTOM,"Scilly is a giant ball of ice that would have been long forgotten if it weren't host to bacterial colonies beneath its icy crust. It was bought by Tri-Tachyon following the bankruptcy of a mining company several cycles ago. During the change of ownership, troubles exploded on the planet, mostly between religious locals and the newly arrived Tri-Tachyon mercenaries, traders, and staff. Most farmers fled to Nirut and Barra, and Scilly now merely serves as a trade center between several factions, scavengers, and other parties.",,,
planet_lepia,CUSTOM,"Lepia was in the final stages of terraforming when the gates closed. While habitable, the atmosphere was still unfit to breath. Colonists already there were forced to adapt. Out of necessity, they turned Lepia into a remote place of entertainment for privateers, adventurers, unscrupulous peoples, and other scum. In exchange, the den benefits from security and supplies brought in by these marginal clients.",,,
planet_bythinia,CUSTOM,"Originally a dump for space junk, Bythinia was recently outfitted with a scavenging outpost to salvage what was possible from the ruined hulks in order to supply the rest of the Corvus sector. Ludd is believed to have stayed here for a time, and since its beatification the planet has attracted many pilgrims, which eventually led the Knights of Ludd to overtake Bythinia to ensure protection of the sacred world and its visitors.",,,
barra_station1,CUSTOM,"Designed as a space dock to assist in the terraformation of the Ivree system, Barra station was flooded by refugees fleeing pogroms on Prato. The Luddic Church soon annexed the station to protect refugees while keeping an eye on Prato and the maiden world of Nirut. Most refugees live in cramped conditions, toiling endlessly to construct new ships for the Church.",,,
planet_tenas,CUSTOM,"After the Collapse, Tenas was home to a small colonization attempt to exploit small but easily accessible ore lodes to feed Nepheria's industry. Following the coming of regional powers and interstellar trading, working conditions on Tenas quickly deteriorated, leading to large strikes across the world. The Hegemony and Persean League used this opportunity to wrestle for control of the Utic system. In the end, Tenas was brought into the League under the guns of the combined League fleets on the pretext of eventually bringing order and security to its people, and guarding against Hegemony annexation.",,,
ChibogStation1,CUSTOM,"Chibog station is a large zero-G industrial platform used initially to refine ores from Tenas during the isolation of the Utic system. Following a revolt on the mining planet, the Hegemony and Persean League struggled for control of the whole system, but Nepheria proved resilient enough to retain its independence. The station is now a Hegemony outpost acting as a diplomatic ground with the nearby Tri-Tachyon and Persean League presence.",,,
planet_nirut,CUSTOM,"Nirut is the fruit of planetary terraforming at its best. It was nearly habitable when the Gates closed, with only a few thousand people present on the planet. They had to live isolated for tens of cycles before being rediscovered by the Hegemony. Despite its low population, the planet is valued and heavily guarded against potential invasion by Tri-Tachyon or raids from Luddic Church extremists based on Barra.",,,
