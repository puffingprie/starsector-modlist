One does rarely choose to became a pirate. Most often than not, fate precipitate you in a path were you have not choice but to fight by any mean to survive. During the Mazalot incident, many patrol fleets were forced to flee the wrath of the Persean League. Some choose to rally independent worlds, while others, such as you, decided to fight back.

However, one cannot desert and strike on the League without consequences. Harbors are closed to you, and supply is getting scarcer, while your ships are ridden with battle damage.

While preying near the Tyle system, luck is upon you: a small salvage fleet, is coming back with its holds full. It should make a great way of replenish supplies, and could even provide one or two additions to your fleet.
