The Church of Ludd has always been at odds with technologies which defy the marvel of creation. True IAs are considered heresy and aberration, as only God has the right to create sensient creature.

For the Church, starships, technology and improvement of human life are merely tools and are tolerated as long as they do not defy the laws of Nature. As such, fleets of the Congregation are made of low-tech ships whose crew barely know how to man it. New designs are crude mash-up of existing and reliable components. Several fleets know has “Reclamation” have the duty of finding, hunting and destroying any aberration and heretical technology.

In  178, word has reached that a Hegemony salvage fleet was coming back from the outer reaches with a powerful IA core found in a huge derelict space installation. A Reclamation fleet was commissioned to make sure this fleet, and its precious cargo, encounter a deadly end as it will enter in the Sector.
