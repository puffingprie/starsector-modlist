drone_GM_Borer,SHIP,"This derivative of the Borer Drone has the engines overtuned, additional weapon systems installed into the frame, and a Tactical Weapon Intergation Terminator unit, known colloquially as a TWIT unit. While light, fragile, packing admittedly weak weaponry, and still unable to move far form the parent vessel, these drones work as moderately effective point defense.",,,
talon_GM,SHIP,"An analogue of the Talon, this flight craft is just as fragile but blisteringly fast. The vulcan cannon is replaced by a Bluebottler Gun, enabling the ship to pressure and disrupt enemy formations. However the validity of a suppression role for an interceptor as frighteningly light as the Talon (GM) is up for debate, even with the flare system.",,,
broadsword_GM,SHIP,"The Lurgi Suppression Beam, a laser like device that had all the stopping power of a Tractor Beam within a reasonably sized assembly, was considered to be a perfect pursuit weapon for the Authority. However, difficulties in attaching it to proper frigate sized pursuit vessels were problematic. Instead, the engineers at G&M decided to build the weapon, then construct a suitably robust fighter frame around it. The Broadsword hull turned out to be the perfect frame, producing an effective long-range interceptor and a brilliant disruptor of fighter formations. However, this fighter was designed to be used in a supportive role; without proper assistance the GM Broadsword is nothing more than an annoying bullet magnet.",,,
thunder_GM,SHIP,"Based on the Thunder fighter hull, the Grytpype and Moriarty Thunder is a harassment bomber, able to strafe targets quickly and disable weapons systems after first dropping a payload of highly electronically disruptive unguided Dumb Bludknock Chasers. Against foes who are even transiently aware of it, however, the Thunder (GM) is not suited for continued maintenance of structural integrity longer than thirty one seconds.",,,
gladius_GM,SHIP,"The Grytpype and Moriarty Gladius is designed specifically for an anti-fighter role, but since expanded into a dominant all round fighter option. Armed with two of the famed and inscrutable Henry Crun Fighter Disrupter (and High Strength Grime Remover) Gun and an ion cannon, this fighter can turn enemy fighters and missiles into glitteringly clean fragments in space with frightening efficiency. Against larger targets this platform proves disappointing.",,,
piranha_GM,SHIP,"A simple conversion of the Piranha, the Piranha (GM) removes the bomb bays and replaces it with three Breach SRM missiles. While the armour integrity of the craft is best described as 'existent', the bomber can nevertheless strip prone enemies of armour in continued engagements, enabling follow-up strikes by Thunder (GM)s to pack a considerably greater punch.",,,
,,,,,
drone_borer_GMFS,SHIP,"A simple and straightforward conversion of the Borer drone for the Shepherd (GMFS), this craft packs a Louix Flame Suppression system to contain fires and hull breaches on ships, and a Milton signalgun as an impromptu welder. An excellent assistant for ship repair and recovery, in combat it is useful for little more than annoying enemy craft.",,,
warthog_GMFS,SHIP,"Requiring a craft to assist in repair and recovery operations of the Gemini (GMFS), the Fire Service turned to the sturdy Warthog chassis. With heavy armour to protect the crew and repair and retrieval equipment, the Warthog (GMFS) could get to high risk regions and mitigate damage to ships and retrieve key items from wrecks. In combat the Milton Welding torch and signalguns can be utilised to chew through enemy armour, however the craft lacks the speed, power and reach to have a significant impact.",,,
perdition_GMFS,SHIP,"Requiring a large chassis to attach a lot of salvage and repair equipment, the GMFS turned to the Perdition. Stripping out the Hammer launcher and applying ludicrous amounts of armour along with the tools and equipment necessary for salvage and repair, the Perdition (GMFS)  could enter into extremely hazardous areas and perform its duties without the loss of the craft. In combat this craft possesses Milton Signalguns for point-defense, and a Pomsom Blaster for self-defense, making it an effective wingman for combined fighter operations.",,,
talon_GMHS,SHIP,"While the Mudskipper (GMHS) is packed with medical equipment, there was very little room for defensive capabilities. Unable to attach weapons to the ship, the GMHS instead attached them to the Talons they were using as rescue and retrieval shuttles. In order to guarantee that their patients would comply, and that the main craft would remain safe, these Talons were given an inordinate amount of improved weaponry.",,,
broadsword_GMHS,SHIP,"With the Nebula (GMHS) vulnerable to attack, significant responsibility for the defense of the craft, as well as enforcing the mercy of the GMHS on unwilling patients fell onto the rescue shuttles. These shuttles were replaced with significantly improved Broadswords that possess the ability to nimbly retrieve patients, as well as ensure these patients come quietly.",,,
gladius_GMHS,SHIP,"Less a rescue shuttle and more a sledgehammer of authority and defense, the Gladius (GMHS) is the Health Service's answer to the Starliner (GMHS) meagre weaponry and paper-thin armour. Able to demolish enemy fighters and retrieve patients with terrifying efficiency, the Gladius (GMHS) is an angel of mercy to some and a demonic harbinger to others.",,,
,,,,,
kite_GM,SHIP,"Used for scouting, pinning smaller frigates and providing limited fire support, the Kite (GM) is unique for having a scavanged EMP emitter attached to the chassis, and having a more variable loadout. This enables the ship to quickly flank and attack more sluggish enemies, while also providing point defense duties. Equipped with the signature Bludknock Overdrive system, this ship is the first into combat - and should, quite sensibly, be the first one to leave it.",,,
vigilance_GM,SHIP,"Needing a solid support frigate for larger combat operations, the designers at G&M took the standard Vigilance hull and combined it with a Brawler chassis to create the Rushcutter. The Vigilance's missile mount was consolidated into two composite mounts in the Brawler structure, and thick Elington Ablative Armour was installed to enhance the ship's durability. While this considerably increases the survivability of the Rushcutter, the focus towards a heavier frame resulted in not enough space being put aside for missile autoloaders and ammo storage. Regardless, the alterations elevate the Rushcutter from a tactically flexible support ship into a an effective anvil to bounce attacks off. The lack of appropriate defence coverage, however, is a critical flaw in the design, making it incredibly vulnerable to attacks from the side or rear.",,,
cerberus_GM,SHIP,"With the number of Shepherds and Cerberii in their stockpiles rising due to regular patrols, there was growing pressure in Grytpype and Moriarty to make a viable vessel out of each. Lead Engineer Henry Crun simply bypassed the issue by combining the Shepherd and Cerberus into the same vessel. With improvements to the Borer Drone bay to produce a nimble point defense the Cerberus (GM) is an effective escort vessel that can double as a salvage vessel, which is let down by an absent shield generator and a missing cargo hold.",,,
,,,,,
wolf_GM,SHIP,"One of the first ship modifications done by Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority, this Wolf analogue is its standard workhorse . Fast and manueverable, this ship can effectively strike fleeing targets, and effectively withdraw in the face of determined resistance. However, the extent of the modifications made to accomodate the Bludknock Overdrive system quickly wears down on the length of time this ship can remain active in combat.",,,
wolf_GMs,SHIP,"Taking the basic Wolf hull, the Grytpype and Moriarty Engineering Division decided that it was simply not available enough for the standard layman to purchase. So, to fill this demand for independant patrols, the Wolf GM Stock was created. The basic Wolf hull has its armour replaced with civilian-grade armour, and its engines replaced with Bludknock's Cenapod Engines, producing a fast if cheap weapons platform.",,,
wolf_GMHQ,SHIP,"A product of refined engineering by chief GMDA designers Moor Dachas and Goff Bludknock, the Wolf (GMHQ) is considered to be the pinnacle of Wolf modification. Something of a compromise between the two women, the design matches a ridiculous level of armament with tactical versatility. With a superior OBE flux system, an increase in mount size, and the inclusion of a terminator drone bay, this vessel is considered a marvel of bleeding edge design.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
lasher_GM,SHIP,"Finding themselves with several scavanged Lasher hulls during the course of Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority patrols, the GMDA decided to use the junk and turn it into a classier, more useful model. The Lasher GM contains the standard suite of GMDA modifications (specifically Bludknock Overdrive system), and can provide effective and fast anti-frigate support anywhere on the battlefield or during any point of a pursuit.",,,
lasher_GMs,SHIP,"Taking the basic Lasher hull, the Grytpype and Moriarty Engineering Division decided that it was simply not available enough for the standard layman to purchase. So, to fill this demand for independant patrols, the Lasher-GM Stock was created. The basic Lasher hull has its armour replaced with civilian-grade Little Jim Streamlined Multilayered Polymer Armour, and its engines replaced with Bludknock's Cenapod Engines, producing a fast if cheap weapons platform.",,,
lasher_GMHQ,SHIP,"The Lasher (GMHQ) was originally designed as a hotbed for possible flux systems and gadgets, as well as testing miniaturised phase systems that were later used in the Sunder (GMHQ) and Hammerhead (GMHQ). At the end of the testing a design process, Moor Dachas and Goff Bludknock gave the ship to engineer Eccles, in the hope that the annoying creature would blow himself up and allow them to collect the insurance money for replacing said hunk of now worthless junk. Much to their immense surprise, they discovered that their experimental prototype in the vague shape of a Lasher hull turned out to be not only a functional vessel, but also an effective weapons platform. Despite attempts to refine the design, the extended phase coil cooldown on emerging from cloak was never fully resolved. Nevertheless, this vessel is very good at flanking and kiting manoeuvres.",,,
,,,,,
gremlin_GM,SHIP,"The Gremlin (GMHQ) is the most common vessel of the Grytpype and Moriarty High Quality series. Finding themselves with multiple Gremlin hulls, and finding a lack of market desire for such craft, the designers at the GMDA decided to overhaul the Gremlin into something useful. With a conversion to energy mounts and implementing a high energy focus system, the Gremlin (GMHQ) is markedly better than its base model - although just about anything could be described as better than the base model.",,,
,,,,,
mudskipper_GMHS,SHIP,"The smallest GMHS ship, the Mudskipper (GMHS) comes equipped with fast-responder medical equipment and a computer database for correcting minor injuries and stabilising more serious conditions. Combined with ample crew space and a wing of Talon (GMHS) shuttles, this ship can provide substantial assistance in saving crew in post-combat situations. The ship itself however is incredibly fragile, and if caught without its escort will be shredded to scrap in short order once its flares have been expended.

While the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority is well known for providing 'security' to independent markets, it is also well-know for its subsidary the Grytpype and Moriarty Health Service. This organisation is perceived in a rather mixed fashion, as while it provides fast if somewhat dubious emergency medicinal services, the GMHS is also incredibly expensive. Many poorer starfarers who have been saved by the Health Service quickly find themselves in crushing debt to the service in order to pay their medical bills, to the point where they prefer to deny assistance. This has resulted in a somewhat strange war between prospective patients and their rescuers.",,,
shepherd_GMFS,SHIP,"This GMFS derivative of the Shepherd replaces a lot of the cargo space with an improved gantry for repair and salvage and an upgraded Borer Drone manufactory. While still vulnerable in combat, the Shepherd (GMFS) is usually nimble enough to escape grief and rely on its Extinguisher drones to protect itself. Nevertheless, it is out of combat where this craft truly shines as an axuiliary support vessel, hastening repairs and assisting in salvage operations.

While the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority is well known for providing 'security' to independent markets, it is also well-know for its subsidary the Grytpype and Moriarty Fire Service. This service is one of the more 'saner' arms of the GMDA, being dedicated to straightforward repair of broken craft, and salvage of what remains if unrepairable. However, while this arm is better regarded, it tends to be a problematic arm in that it tends to be more dedicated to keeping work than actually performing it. If contracted to perform a service there is only a partial chance that they will show up in an emergency, and if there is a risk of being replaced with a more reliable service then the GMFS will respond militantly to it, such as destroying said competitor or threatening the main polity to stick with their contract.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
sunder_GM,SHIP,"After synthesizing a good design modification with the Rushcutter, the designers at G&M then turned their attention to the Sunder hull. Consolidating the small missile and medium energy hardpoints produced a ship with a smaller profile and increased forward firepower, at the cost of reduced space for missile ammo and autoloading mechanisms. Further, on hearing that the rear of the Sunder was very vulnerable to attack, the designers at G&M added more dediated rear facing ballistics to cover for rear attacks. The resulting hull is as powerful and aesthetically glorious as it is fragile to direct attack.",,,
sunder_GMHQ,SHIP,"On seeing the Hammerhead (GMHQ) being revealed, the designers of the Sunder (GM) attempted to replicate the phase drive in the Sunder chasis. Unfortunately, the project was plagued with problems. Attempting to fit both a large weapon mounting and a phase coil in a Sunder hull was simply nigh impossible to do effectively. Eventually, with some judicious tweaking, several very expensive prototype models were put into service. However, the problem with the phase coil cooldown on emerging from cloak was never fully fixed, and the weapon mountings were vastly reduced is size. Nevertheless, the opportunity to have an artillery piece with a phase cloak is not one a GMDA patrolman would willingly pass on...as long as they aren't piloting it.",,,
hammerhead_GM,SHIP,"Looking at the venerable Hammerhead design, Henry Crun, head designer at the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority Engineering Division, wondered why the design had a long, thin neck with ample empty space in the middle that could be used for other, better things. The resulting redesign gave birth to the GMDA Hammerhead. With a more compact design and the Bludknock Overdrive system, the GMDA Hammerhead provides much needed fire support for more defiant hardier enemies. Little is said, however, of designer Eccles' idea of taking a Brawler and elongating it to match a Hammerhead design in order to determine whether the empty space was actually useful.",,,
hammerhead_GMHQ,SHIP,"Based on the Hammerhead (GM), this hull has had a phase generator implanted into the engine system and cargo hold area, along with Crun's Ablative Streamlined Multilayered Polymer Armour and the OBENBAR Flux Management System. This quick and nimble destroyer is a menacing frigate hunter-killer on its own, and a devastating strike or support weapon against larger targets. When the foe is more nimble, more formidable or well supported, this ship will be rapidly rendered into ruin, rubble and wreckage.",,,
,,,,,
condor_GM,SHIP,"Needing effective high speed support for its fleets, the Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority took the standard Tarsus, and through redesign and application of Bludknock's Cenapod Engines, the Little Jim Streamlined Multilayered Polymer Armour and an OBE Flux Management System, the resulting modular platform could be used for either carrier or combat roles. This particular Condor-like hull contains two flight decks and ample space for fighter autofactories, along with plenty of mounts to protect it in combat. Useful for pursuit, strike and kiting applications.",,,
,,,,,
tarsus_GM,SHIP,"Needing effective high speed support for its fleets, the Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority took the standard Tarsus, and through redesign and application of Bludknock's Cenapod Engines, the Little Jim Streamlined Multilayered Polymer Armour and an OBE Flux Management System, the resulting modular platform could be used for either carrier or combat roles. This particular ship is the dread of every law-abiding citizen in the Sector - a cunning ship loaded with sensors and targeting calculatories that can detect a kite going half-a-centimeter over the speed limit in Samarra from the other side of Magec. In combat it is greatly feared for its strong missile-strike abilities, armed to the teeth with missile mountings and a missile fabricator to ensure it remains relevant in protracted engagements.",,,
,,,,,
mule_GM,SHIP,"Finding the Mule an easily acquirable and cheap hull, it wasn't long before the engineers at Grytpype and Moriarty produced a retrofit version of the ship. With consolidated missile mounts and the standard suite of the more rigorous Elington Ablative Armour, this freighter functions as an effective anvil in combat situations - although why someone would choose to use a freighter packed with valuable goods to hold the attention of an aggressive pirate is anyone's guess.",,,
,,,,,
buffalo2_GM,SHIP,"With the Buffalo Mk II being a rather easy hull to acquire, the Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority were quick to produce their own conversion. The Buffalo (GM) lacks a shield generator, but makes up for it with an absurd amount of missile ordinance. Able to send a frightening amount of missiles in the general direction of the enemy, the Buffalo (GM) lacks speed, a solid point defense coverage, a shield, armour, teeth, legs or anything of substantive self-defense capability.",,,
,,,,,
nebula_GMHS,SHIP,"Packing several emergency rooms, ample medical equipment and a high-end, automated surgical suite with extensive medical archives, the Nebula (GMHS) is well equipped to act as a medical ship that can service an outpost or a small fleet. Best used to reduce casualties in post-combat situations, the ship itself is strictly a non-combatant and will be torn to shreds without its fighters nearby or its flares on stand-by.

While the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority is well known for providing 'security' to independent markets, it is also well-know for its subsidary the Grytpype and Moriarty Health Service. This organisation is perceived in a rather mixed fashion, as while it provides fast if somewhat dubious emergency medicinal services, the GMHS is also incredibly expensive. Many poorer starfarers who have been saved by the Health Service quickly find themselves in crushing debt to the service in order to pay their medical bills, to the point where they prefer to deny assistance. This has resulted in a somewhat strange war between prospective patients and their rescuers.",,,
gemini_GMFS,SHIP,"A combat freighter turned auxilliary vessel, the Gemini (GMFS) has had most of its cargo removed to make way for an improved repair and salvage gantry. With a wing of Warthog (GMFS) to assist, this ship improves post-combat repair and salvage operations. However, the ship is somewhat vulnerable in combat situations if caught without its fighter complement.

,,,,,
colossus3_GM,SHIP,"The Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority, on acquiring Colossus hulls by perfectly legitimate means that had nothing to do with rampant privateering, quickly devised a redesign to produce a new hull, and had nothing to do with hiding the evidence. The Colossus (GM) packs three fighter manufactories and two medium missile mounts into the Colossus chassis. The cost is almost the complete removal of the cargo bays and what minor armour the ship possessed, but otherwise the craft works as an admirable support vessel in ready supply.",,,
venture_GM_armour,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the Venture's solid armour, hull durability and ease of quasi-legal acquisition, the Venture (GM) has been enhanced by Elington Ablative Armour and overloading with missile mounts of produce a slow but tough nut to crack. Further, the Mining Pod autofactories have been replaced with Gladius (GM) bays to deal with fighter strikes. Able to dish out as much damage as it takes, the ship is let down by the existing Venture's terrible flux capabilities, and how the alteration has effectively deleted the ship's ability to store cargo, fuel or personnel.",,,
,,,,,
starliner_GMHS,SHIP,"The Starliner (GMHS) is a floating hospital in space, with generous wards, emergency rooms, trauma reduction systems, automated operating rooms and lavish crew support systems such as cafes, kitchens and auto-cleaning ammenities. While this ship is able to deal with the medical demand of a small colony, it is unable to deal with any sort of combat situation, and will fail spectacularly without its fighters or flares.

While the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority is well known for providing 'security' to independent markets, it is also well-know for its subsidary the Grytpype and Moriarty Health Service. This organisation is perceived in a rather mixed fashion, as while it provides fast if somewhat dubious emergency medicinal services, the GMHS is also incredibly expensive.

mora_GMFS,SHIP,"A rugged vessel, the Mora (GMFS) possesses a sophisticated repair and salvage gantry, automated salvage equipment, a generous analysis suite for reconstruction, considerable equipment for damage control and containment, and a wing of Perdition (GMFS) craft for repair and recovery. There has been a considerable sacrifice to cargo space to make room for this equipment, however the Mora (GMFS) still packs the armour of the original design and a fast missile rack system, making it an effective and hardy combatant in GMDA fleets - and a terrifying prospect against those who would rethink their contracts to the GMFS.

While the Grytpype and Moriarty Defense Authority is well known for providing 'security' to independent markets, it is also well-know for its subsidary the Grytpype and Moriarty Fire Service.

,,,,,
falcon_GM,SHIP,"Cursory analysis of the Falcon by the Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority's Lead Designer Henry Crun deemed the empty void space in the design to be rather pointless. By replacing this empty space with more ship, a theoretically better design could be achieved. Pointedly ignoring the common reply (It's called an Eagle you idiot!), the Falcon (GM) became the heavier option for patrol fleets. By consolidating the missile and medium ballistic hardpoints, a more compact and striking design was made to increase tactical flexibility, albeit at the cost of reduced missile effectiveness. With as much power as possible wrangled out of the Bludknock Overdrive system, the resulting ship is a masterpiece of bleeding edge engineering. Emphasis on the bleeding part.",,,
venture_GM,SHIP,"Originally a modification of the base Venture, the Venture (GMHQ) was wrung multiple times through several design and engineering processes to create a command and support vessel for the GMDA. The resulting ship is vaguely reminiscent of the Venture, but is much more deadly. Bearing Crun's Ablative Streamlined Multilayered Polymer Armour, the OBENBAR Flux Management System, two flight decks and a generous weapons loadout, the Venture (GMHQ) can suit many different fleet roles from carrier support to artillery support.",,,
,,,,,
atlas_GM,SHIP,"With a steady supply of Atlas hulls that the GMDA needed to discretely dispose of, and requiring a fast, cheap capital to bulk out fleets, the GMDA attempted to resolve both issues by attempting to make a GMDA analogue of the Atlas Mk II. The design was surprisingly quick to put together and implement, courtesy of the pre-existing Atlas Mk II modification and famed head engineer Henry Crun applying his steaming art to the project. The result was more of an oversized but nimble missile cruiser lacking the ability to produce sustained fire support but able to quickly nip into combat, deliver a load of missile ordinance, and nimbly nip back out again.",,,
onslaught_GM,SHIP,"A dawning paradox, the Onslaught (GM) is a big ship with big speed and big ordinance but zero armour.

A heavy capital ship has long been a desired addition to the GMDA fleet doctrine. Unfortunately the ship designs were either materially unsuitable for widespread construction, or simply not conducive to moving at high speed with an appreciable amount of firepower. Eventually head engineer Henry Crun crafted a design for a high-speed Onslaught, with stripped down mass and armour. The initial prototype for this ship hit burn speed 22 before it fell apart over Arcadia, and the high-speed cloud of high-tech debris was quickly seized by port authorities. A more sensible redesign by Moor Dachus produced a heavier, slower design, that while not as fast as the original, was still quite nimble enough to keep up with larger combat operations. The Onslaught (GM) is faster than it looks, and bears a considerable amount of forward facing firepower. However, the higher cost to produce and maintain makes the use of these ships prohibitive, ensuring that these are a rare sight in GMDA Police Operations.",,,
onslaught_GMHQ,SHIP,"A terrifying thought experiment by one of the biggest idiots in Sector histroy, breathed into life by the insane genius of GMDA engineers, this phase-capable Onslaught analogue is shockingly nimble in phase but vulnerable in real space.

During the initial design phase of the Onslaught (GM), several speed-increasing designs were rejected, simply because they couldn't make the Onslaught move fast enough. Annoyingly, engineer Eccles had been wasting considerable computing time on improving the Onslaught's aerodynamics, positing that if the ship moved through air fast, then it should more through space even quicker. The idea was rejected out of hand, until Goff Bludknock had a brainwave - instead of moving the ship through space, while not move it through p-space instead? Thus, the abomination called the Onslaught (GMHQ) was born. A hideously expensive ship, the sheer number and concentration of phase generators attached to this ship made the possibility of the vessel falling into p-space and never returning a real possibility. To counter this a new system of 'dimensional hooks' fix the Onslaught into a point and direction in real space, which while preventing the ship from falling into oblivion makes it difficult to move in real space. Further, while moving out of phase space, the coils require a long time to equilibriate enough for reuse, meaning that manoeuvers with this ship often require considerable forethought. However, when the ship enters phase space, the speed and maneuverability of the Onslaught (GMHQ) is unparalleled, making this battlecruiser the perfect ambush predator. Trying to make a stable version of this ship is very difficult, and the costs in both supply and make are exorbitant, especially considering that the damage output, although suprising, is not enough to justify the cost. Consequently, this ship was moved out of production, although some Ministers and Captains may steal a prototype to either prove its usefulness, or maybe just test their skills in one of the biggest phase ships in the Sector.",,,

gmda,FACTION,"Creatively acquired by the Right Royal Sir Hercules Grytpype-Thynne and the Left Count Jim 'Thighs' Moriarty, the Grytpype and Moriarty Defence Authority is a controversial organisation within the sector. For those travelling under an independent charter, the GMDA is an effective police force, keeping trade lanes clear of pirates, thieves and Luddic raiders. Selling their loot and salvage at non-aligned worlds, the GMDA enrich markets with additional resources, and more often than not are on hand more immediately and reliably to deal with threats than the distant and dubious protection of the other major factions. This means that, quite often, non-aligned leaders and station managers are willing to overlook the fact that the GMDA consider 'pirates' to not only include raiders and pathers, but also every ship flying a faction flag. Indeed, the GMDA is willing to assault merchantile convoys of other factions to enrich themselves and the independent spaceports they call home. This often brings them into conflict with other alliances, but due to their unofficial protection of higher-ups on selected independent planets, they have proven to be immensely difficult to remove.
