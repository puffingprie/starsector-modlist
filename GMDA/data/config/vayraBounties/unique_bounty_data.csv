The aim of William Mate was originally unclear - it was believed that he was taking the prototypical fleet for a pirate hunting expedition and testing of the weapons systems, but now it has become clear that Mate has turned deserter. The Authority has released a generous bounty for his elimination, but has left a piece of critical information out of the bounty request which your contacts have helpfully filled in: namely, that William Mate is using an experimental Onslaught with a phase cloak as his flagship.
