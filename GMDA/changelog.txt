-Defintiely, Actually Fixed the Speeding Ticket Encounter Dialogue Actually.

0.9.5b
-Actually Fixed the Speeding Ticket Encounter Dialogue For Realsies.

-Kite (GMHQ) max speed reduced slightly
-Onslaught (GM) sprite altered - it's now wider.

0.9.5
-GMDA Overhauled - again
	-Ships are much more powerful across the board, but are more expensive to maintain and cost more to deploy.
	-Faction now brought more strictly in line with CABAL's extortion script, however they will only ever demand money.
	-Fleets will pretend to be independant if threatened.
-Added Mercenary Outposts - very expensive colony structures that add defense fleets to your markets, proportional to market size. Right now there are only two:
	-Nedwin Seagoon Security Depot - Provides a complement of defending fleets to your market, except they're all GMDA affiliated. Requires good relations with GMDA to build.
	-Condottiere Mercenary Company - Provides independant military patrols, however the number and size of the patrols is very limited for the cost.
	-Only one can be built at a time, however it is possible to cheese this.
-Renamed Condor (GM), Tarsus (GMs) and Tarsus (GM) to Carker, Hummer and Jutter, respectively.
-Venture (GM) overhauled; new sprite that looks more Venture-ish, is now a better support vessel than the old version.

-Wolf (GMs) and Lasher (GMs) removed from rotation. Kept as legacy, until I figure out what to do with them.
-The modular Lurgi Suppression beam is now a medium weapon, and has been consequently buffed.


0.9.4b
-Changed the DP of the Condor (GM) and Venture (GM), should a bit more balanced to use.
-Tweaked the Sunder (GMHQ) to be better.
-Reworked the overdrive Hullmod - now gives a scaling bonus dependant on flux level, with increased speed, acceleration, venting and damage output at high flux, but also range maluses down to 450 s.u. at high flux.

0.9.4a
-Hotfix to change the GMs hullmod crash.
-Tweaked the Bluebottler Gun to be more flux efficient.

0.9.4
-GMDA hullmod now actually works.
-Coloured GMs ships removed from rotation. Kept as a legacy, however, to prevent game crashing.
-Added the Kite (GMHQ), Lasher (GMHQ) and Wolf (GMHQ)
-Tweaked various sprites and weapons.
-Changed the GMDA faction flag.


0.9.3
-Clarified the GMDA playstyle by breaking the hullmods into two base hullmods
	-Bludknock Engines, which gives a zero-flux speed boost while blocking the engine mods
	-Overdrive System, which explains the boosts at high flux and drawbacks to using the system
-Due to the inclusion of the Speeding Ticket system (Similar to Luddic Path), the chances of being completely ganked by GMDA fleets has been mitigated for early game fleets. Consequently, a lot of the nerfs have been removed from GMDA ships, making them more attractive.
-Standard GM Stock ships are now worse, but cheaper.
-Coloured GMs ships are now rarer and better - in the future they may be phased out completely, excluding any future ideas to make a Wolf with Terminator Drones, a Phase Lasher, or an EMP kite.
-Altered various ship stats to be more compliant with 0.9.1a.
-The Crun Gun, in addition to Fighter Elimination, is now also good at general purpose PD, while the Bluebottler gun and Modular Lurgi Suppression Beam have been slightly improved.
-The Sprites for all of the frigates (excluding the Kite), and the Sagitus duo have been reworked
-The Tarsus (GM), Tarsus (GMs) and Condor (GM) have been reworked both in sprite and function
-GMDA blueprints now have images in them.
-Descriptions have had a pass over - still might be mistakes lurking in there somwehere.

0.9.2d
-Updated ship prices etc. for 0.9.1a.

0.9.2c
Removed some variants from HMI that had snuck in somehow.

0.9.2b
-Coloured Lashers and Wolves hit with the buff bat.

0.9.2a
-Lasher (GMs) and Wolf (GMs) have been reworked
	-Grey GMs ships are worse than their respective vanilla versions, but cheaper to run.
	-Coloured GMs ships have been buffed to fit with their drawbacks to make them more attractive, but made rarer to see in patrols.
-GMDA and GMs hullmods now have the high flux speed boost activate at lower thresholds (65% and 75%, respectively), and the speeds tweaked.
-Description for Shift Jets added
-Bribe script tweaked - should be more forgiving...?

0.9.2
-Added Phase hullmod to Sunder (GMHQ)
-All GMDA ships with overdrive have had their mobility systems downgraded in quality and their speeds slightly cut.
	-It made no real sense where the playstyle was to sacrifice speed between low and high flux, and yet have shipsystems that mitigated this.

0.9.1a
-Fixed Hullmod Description Crash
-Fixed Glow Sprite of Onslaught (GMHQ)

0.9.0
-Updated to 0.9.0a
-Minor sprite updates across the board.
-Onslaught (GM) and Onslaught (GMHQ) have been tweaked to have less weapon mounts in general; ordinance has been tweaked accordingly.
-The Bludknock missiles fired from the Thunder (GM) are now weaker, and move faster
-The GMDA hullmod has (again) undergone a change in function; hulls now also have a passive vent bonus above 80% flux, and an overload duration increase of 150%.
	*This should now make it clear that these ships favour high risk-high reward playstyles.
-GMDA markets now give a good bonus to accessibility, but reduce stability.
-Added in a 'Bribe' script similar to Luddic Path; openning the comm link when engaged will reveal an option to pay a speeding ticket instead of being attacked; particularly useful for small, early game fleets.


0.8.3
-Added the Sunder GMHQ - Phase Sunder Protoype. Emphasis - PROTOTYPE.
-Tweaked Spawn code so fleets are a lot less likely to spawn on top of you in hyperspace.

0.8.2
-GM Ship speeds tweaked to be slower outside of zero flux and elevated flux
-GMs ships will now show occassionally show up in Independant fleets

-Added Gladiator Bounties.


0.8
-Sprite Tweaks to Falcon and Venture.

	-Cargo and Fuel capacity drawbacks and improved maneuverability remain unchanged.

0.7

-Sunder (GM) added; loses two small missiles and two medium energies, replaced with two medium synergy, suffers from Poor missile Integration (see above)
-Vigilance (GM) added; loses traditional layout two get two medium synergies, suffers from Poor Missile Integration (See Above)
