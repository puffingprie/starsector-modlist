thg_starlight,WEAPON,"An ambitious weapon based on the technology behind the infamous Mjolnir, the starlight point defense cannon fires a flurry of unstable  magneto-gravitic projectiles trapped within a thin plasma field which, upon impacting any particle - be it the hull of a ship or a micrometeoroid, violently erupts in an EMP-rich discharge. Designed to take down modern, shielded fightercraft, it is effective against most all small targets, and still stands viable as a sustained disruption weapon against larger craft, though it's flux effeciency leaves much to be desired owing to the raw heat generated by it's hybrid loading system.",,,,
thg_starlight_single,WEAPON,"The smallest member of the Starlight plasma magneto-gravitic cannon family, the Starlite employs the same technology as it's larger brethren, though in an ultra-compact package. The resulting weapon is still quite effecient as a point defense weapon against virtually all targets, though it struggles greatly from overheating and flux effeciency issues due to the complexity of it's mechanism combined with a miniaturized flux sink.",,,,
thg_starlight_double,WEAPON,"The mid-sized mounting in the Starlight plasma cannon family, the Starbright employs the same technology as it's larger brother in a more compact package, firing EMP-inducing unstable energy proximity rounds in high volumes, proving effective against virtually all targets, though at a sharp cost in flux effeciency and raw damage output when compared to more traditional flak weaponry.",,,,
thg_remnant_swarmer_fighter,WEAPON,"A rotary tube of swarmer-pattern missiles, which has been upgraded by AI design into a much swifter design, swapping out it's archaic explosive warhead in favor of a slightly lighter energy-based charge, carrying with it a powerful EMP effect capable of disabling enemy fighter craft and small vessel's weapon systems.",,,,
thg_plaspulser,WEAPON,"A lightweight energy weapon originally designed to be mounted to light fighter craft, though it quickly gained popularity as a light mounting on auxillary craft thanks to it's low mounting overhead and PD capability.",,,,
thg_plaspulserbig,WEAPON,"The predecessor to the slightly more advanced Paladin PD system, the Chaplain utilizes an array of projectile-based plasma pulsers to fire a withering hail of relatively stable plasma projectiles to wipe out fighter and missile screens alike. While roughly as effective as a standard paladin system in most regards, it's not quite as reliable against extremely fast targets owing to it's projectiles travel time.",,,,
thg_squalorftr,WEAPON,"A rather complex, yet ingenious system allowing fighter-sized craft to continually produce and launch squall-class kinetic missiles, providing a long-range pressure weapon as well as a decent interceptor missile, owing to it's comparitively quick time-to-arm compared to capital-grade variations.",,,,
thg_accretion,SHIP,"Essentially a flying, AI-operated hangar equipped with an extensive supplementary sensor suite, the Accretion-class droneship carrier cruiser provides autonomous AI fleets with a solid rear-echelon support vessel, capable of screening a wide area with it's PD oriented weapons package while releasing swarms of autonomous fighters, or providing long-range support with it's missile package.",,,,
thg_crisis,SHIP,"Borne from  a joint venture well before the collapse between Tritachyon and Orbital Fabrique's lead engineers on their wildly successful 'Kite', the Crisis features a notably heavier weapons package coupled with improved combat capabiltiies across the board, ranging from an upgraded flux core and shield to improved engines coupled with a plasma-jet injector system, providing it with nigh-on unmatched mobility for a combat vessel.",,,,
thg_crisismkii,SHIP,"A modifiaction of the Crisis undertaken - presumably - by AI interference, owing to it's lack of a catalogue date prior to the collapse. It's AI contaiment core has been greatly miniaturized and re-located, with the excess space having been re-utilized to house a compact launch bay and microforge, capable of producing a single Spark-class escort drone. Though this modification causes a slight reduction in flux performance owing to the necessary re-routing of power, it overall greatly improves the survivability of the craft in a skirmishing role.",,,,
thg_sarcophagus,SHIP,"An exceptionally compact modular autonomous carrier, the smallest of which was produced by Tritachyon prior to the collapse of the gate network. It's arms package is relatively light, though it is more than capable of providing light missile support alongside it's fighter complement to front-line skirmisher drones and larger battle lines alike, while maintaining an extremely tight logistical profile for it's size and purpose.",,,,
thg_sacrophagusmkii,SHIP,"A modification of the Sarcophagus presumably undertaken through post-collapse AI modification, which does away with it's integrated hangar bay in favor of carrying a more substantial arms package. It furthermore strips it's predecessor's active flare system, instead integrating a microburn injector in order to facilitate use as an exceptionally aggressive light skirmisher craft. Viciously effective against other small craft, though grossly prone to over-extending itself in large-scale battle scenarios.",,,,
thg_sacrophagus3,SHIP,"The third iteration of the Sarcophagus that was not catalogued until after the first AI war, this terrifyingly effecient, compact phase vessel once again has undergone radical AI modification, miniaturizing it's AI containment core in a manner akin to the Crisis MKII and re-locating it in order to make room for the integration of a highly effecient flux coil, allowing it to delve and loiter in P-space for extended periods of time thanks to it's lack of any bio-organic crew and the effeciency of it's phase system. Though it is forced to do away with it's shield core to account for the increased flux requirements of it's new systems, it now integrates a slow-feed plasma jet injector as opposed to it's predecessors burst microburn system, allowing it overall improved mobility in the brief moments in which it's not in phase to skirt away from enemy fire.",,,,
thg_shuriken,SHIP,"An aggressively shaped yet defensively oriented hull, the Shuriken's overarching lines of fire combined with it's bristling array of active flare projectors makes it an exemplar support vessel, more than capable of destroying entire missile salvos with it's active defense systems as well as screening wide areas against small craft and fighters.",,,,
thg_praxius,SHIP,"Overtly hostile and highly mobile, the Praxius is designed as a front-lines skirmisher, capable of quickly burning to meet any opposition before assailing them with it's substantial forward arms package.",,,,
thg_whisker,SHIP,"One of the few phase-capable autonomous designs which pre-dates the collapse of the Domain's gate network, the Whisker serves as a terrifyingly effecient phase destroyer. It's forward-arms package provides it with both the capability to mount both heavy energy weaponry along with a substantial missile package, granting this vessel incredible strike potential, while it's upgraded phase coils are capable both of fully submering the vessel in P-space as well as skipping short distances via phase displacement. An expensive vessel for most autonomous fleets to maintain, though often times well worth it.",,,,
thg_sheath_core,SHIP,"Unorthodox and highly aggressive in it's design, the Sheath sports a rather compact profile compared to most cruisers which led many of it's originaly investors to be taken aback by it's high cost of production and maintenance requirements. This comes, however, as a result of it's complicated split systems, in which it's frontal armor actually contains a sink-linked indepedent flux system, coupled with a gamma-level AI gunnary assistant and miniaturized shield generator, essentially combining two independent autonomous vessels into one, hyper-aggressive strike cruiser. The rear module's heavy missile mounting coupled with it's plasma burn injector system allow it to rush head-strong into the thick of combat, and it's modular armor coupled with it's split flux system and supplementary shield generator allow it to take an exceptional amount of forward-punishment before becoming outfluxed by enemy combatants, all the while returning heavy firepower from one or both of it's modules.",,,,
thg_galaxy,SHIP,"A collosal craft built off the same skeletal structure as the infamous Remnant battle stations, this collosus of an autonomous battleship was only brought to fruition in a single instance before the outset of the first AI war as a flagship honeypot for prospective investors in Tritachyon's autonomous weapons research, meant to showcase the full capabilities of nigh-on all the features which autonomous craft had to offer. It's hangar and gunnary modules each contain supplementary delta-level AI assistants which link directly to the central unit's targeting feed and processing systems, and it's shared flux sink combined with it's independent 'Colloseum' heavy fortress shield generator allow it to undertake a truly oppressive amount of sustained fire power before necessitating the lowering of it's defensive systems. Though impressive, it was seen as highly impractical to produce more than one owing to the vessel's immense cost of upkeep combined - though following the outset of the first AI war, more and more of these monstrous vessels have, for whatever reason, been sighted among the remnants of autonomous fleets.",,,,
thg_rathaus,SHIP,"Predating the design of the highly experimental Radiant-class by a hair, the Rathaus is somewhat less ambitious in it's design philosophy, designed as a fleet anchor for large-scale autonomous fleets from which to project truly oppressive missile and fighter support. This, coupled with it's dual-layered shield generator array make it an exceptionally tough nut to crack, and though it's armament is often considered to be support-oriented, it is still more than capable of serving as a front line battleship owing to it's excellent flux systems and exceptional defensive capabilities.",,,,
thg_gleam,SHIP,"A compact fighter with an ingenous design, built around a minaiturized squall-class missile launcher coupled with an effecient missile microforge. The Gleam excels at both providing sustained kinetic pressure against craft of all sizes when deployed en masse, as well as considerable anti-fighter capabilities thanks to the modified squall's ability to track and intercept small targets, albeit with slight delay despite their upgraded target aquesition and launch systems.",,,,
thg_hone,SHIP,"A practical autonomous bomber-fighter, the Hone is built around a single, highly versatile Atropos-class torpedo launcher, with a supplementary armament consisting of front dual-mounted plaspulsers for anti-fighter and limited anti-missile interception. Extremely swift and highly reliable for a bomber craft thanks to it's high-quality shield generator and relatively thick armor plating, though very expensive to field and slow to re-fit and replace when compared to other bomber craft owing to the complexity of it's systems.",,,,
thg_hydra,SHIP,"Shortly following the creation of the Dragonfire DEM missile, Tritachyon investors immediately saw the potential for the highly-advanced torpedo to be integrated in to an equally advanced fighter-bomber craft. Utilizing the chassis of the venerable Hone at it's core, this grossly oversized bomber vessel shares only the vaguest resemblence to it's mother craft, having undergone radical modification to accomodate for the requisite tracking and targeting systems for the effective use of it's DEM armament. The resulting craft procured by unreasonable amounts of investment into this R&D bore an exceptionally expensive, over-sized hangar queen of an autonomous drone; which, despite it's relative ineffeciency and strain on the logistical systems of most all carrier craft, is capable of striking fear into the hearts of any sane officer upon realizing it's presence on the battlefield.",,,,
thg_ember,SHIP,"A miniscule drone fighter, the Ember was designed primarily as a cheap, dispensable support drone, consisting of little more than a minaiturize shield generator, low-grade flux systems and a plaspulser housed in a thin shell of teal.",,,,
thg_visitant,SHIP,"Considered a bleeding-edge prototype by the end of the first AI war and never actually seen deployed in a combat scenario since - at least, there have been no survivors of such encounters. Originally considered the idea of a madman backed by far too many investor's credits, this fearsome vessel combines the swiftness of the experimental Nova device with the terrifying properties of time-accelerated phase diving in order to create a fearsome strike cruiser capable of thrusting itself great distances in the blink of an eye by activating it's explosive drive directly prior to phase-diving, allowing it to quickly position itself behind even the thickest of enemy battle lines in order to deliver it's powerful mixed forward ordinance into the vulnerable rears of enemy vessels.",,,,
thg_remnant_swarmer,WEAPON,"Based off of the more ubiquitous Swarmer SRM launcher, this multiple-launch system has been upgraded by artificial intelligence into an improved interception weapon, trading out it's high-explosive payload for a more versatile energy-based warhead with the added benefit of yielding a notable EMP effect, coupled with improved thrusters granting the individual missiles a better chance of intercepting high-speed targets. Whatever strike craft it fails to kill, it will often times instead leave drifting helplessly toward more scrutinous point-defense weaponry.",,,,
thg_ant,SHIP,"An evil, economic 'swarm' frigate unofficially dubbed the 'Ant Bastard' in some circles, built around the infamous harbinger's Quantum Disruptor system, though much more compactly tucked away without the need to support an organic crew or phase coil system. Though individually weak and fragile, the presence of even a single ant can act as a force multiplier for an autonomous fleet, let alone when employed en masse.",,,,
thg_annex,SHIP,"Yet another design which surfaced only after the closure of the first AI war and writ out entirely from official Tri-Tachyon data stores, this ship was - presumably - procured almost entirely through AI influence. Bearing a striking resemblence to the Conquest - though much more compact and sporting far more effecient systems across the board - this miniaturized analog of the iconic midline vessel is undergunned on the surface, but provides a far more versatile arms package in an extremely agile battlecruiser hull, making it a true terror to face on the battlefield.",,,,
thg_phantasm,SHIP,"Impish in apperance and renown almost as a demonic vessel by point-defense weapons operators, the Phantasm deploys a miniaturized ion pulser much akin to the common crewed Claw, though with supplementary firepower offered by it's plaspulsers, all tucked into an agile, phase-capable package. Capable of occupying point defense weapon systems for a truly disgruntling amount of time, these fighters are a true bane against any low-tech doctrines lacking high-effeciency beam-based anti fighter counter measures, owing to their raw agility and ability to disable weapon systems when deployed en masse.",,,,
thg_solaris,SHIP,"Sporting an axial 'Starlite' plasma-based burst cannon and a highly versatile supplementary armament, the Solaris serves as a powerful multi-tool of a fighter, capable of both easily disabling and destroying enemy fighter craft as well as causing mass disruption against light enemy craft, though it lacks the punch to destroy more heavily armored vessels without supplementary firepower.",,,,
thg_omniscience,SHIP,"A hulking autonomous fighter craft, built entirely around a dual-barreled Starlight point defense cannon with a supplementary plasburster armament and a high-quality 360 degree shield core, granting it exceptional staying power on the front lines and the ability to both disable swarms of enemy fighter craft as well as cause mass disruption against all manner of larger craft.",,,,
thg_resonance,SHIP,"A lightweight autonomous missile platform with built-in ECCM capabilities coupled with fast missile racks in order to rapidly deploy a large amount of missile firepower from the rear echelons of autonomous fleets.",,,,
thg_receptacle,SHIP,"One of the less popular of the original line of autonomous ships designed by Tritachyon in attempts to secure military escort convoy contracts, the Receptacle combines the conveniences of a fully autonomous craft with dramatically increased logistical ability when compared to fighter craft, allowing an easy way to bolster escort convoy's logistical numbers without putting an increased strain on resources - or crew budget. It failed to make any large marketable success, but examples have since sprung up accompanying remnant fleets, acting as logistical support for long-term system patrols.",,,,
thg_stockade,SHIP,"A dastardly autonomous logistics vessel, equipped with a suite of support systems, sensory nodes, and fielding a sizable drone figher escort, designed primarily to aid in salvage and resource recovery ventures, though serving secondarily as a solid defense against would-be pirateers.",,,,
thg_stockpile,SHIP,"A collosal autonomous trade freighter, rivaling the atlas in terms of sheer scale, though with a considerably meaner armament to better match it's size. Designed by Tritachyon in a bid to secure military trade convoy contracts in high-conflict zones, it made it only barely past the prototyping stage before the onset of the collapse. Now, these hulks are only occasionally seen bolstering the ranks of autonomous remnant fleets, serving as vast mobile reserves of supply for repair and rearmament of greater drone forces.",,,,
thg_engineer,SHIP,"A wily little autonomous craft, essentially a high-tech autonomous salvage rig. Unlike normal salvage rigs, this ungainly hull sports armaments - modest though they may be - as well as a considerable array of supplementary sensors.",,,,
thg_desultory,SHIP,"[DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,
thg_shatter,SHIP,"[DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,
